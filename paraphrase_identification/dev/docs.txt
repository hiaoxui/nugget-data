The rationale of the Convergence objective is to promote growth - enhancing conditions and factors leading to real convergence for the least - developed Member States and regions . In EU-27 , this objective concerns - within 18 Member States - 84 regions with a total population of154 million , and per capita GDP at less than 75 % of the Community average , and - on a " phasing - out " basis - another 16 regions with a total of 16.4 million inhabitants and a GDP only slightly above the threshold , due to the statistical effect of the larger EU . It is split as follows : EUR 199.3 billion for the Convergence regions , while EUR 14 billion are reserved for the " phasing - out " regions , and EUR 69.5 billion for the Cohesion Fund , the latter applying to 15 Member States .
L9	The conclusion that the contested measure distorted competition is not only lacking in reasoning , but also erroneous . Indeed , 33 of the 38 Greek airports are served by OA on the basis of public service obligations , without any competition , and about 30 of those airports are of no commercial interest . The applicants put forward no serious ground on which a private investor could base a firm realistic hope of obtaining a satisfactory return from that early payment , having regard to OA 's particularly difficult situation , characterised by the grant of aid to that company over a period of years , the failure of attempts at restructuring and at sale , the persistence of negative results and the aggregation of debts and losses . OA 's private creditors , such as the lessors of aircraft and the banks ABN Amro and Crédit Lyonnais , hastened , moreover , to obtain guarantees from the Hellenic Republic . In addition , it is apparent from the Moore Stephens report that the early payment in question was used to finance operating costs , such as the leasing by OA of aircraft sub - leased to NOA . 272 In that regard , the Commission 's experts found that the sum in question of EUR 130 million had been determined on the basis of data submitted to Deloitte & Touche by OA 's management , without being evaluated by independent inspectors .

The members of the Joint Undertaking shall have a number of votes in proportion to their contribution to the funds of the Joint Undertaking . The results of this exercise , as well as the audits carried out by the Court of Auditors , in the last two annual reports , showed that Member States′ authorities generally follow the requirements , although significant weaknesses still existed in respect of the completeness of data and the system for recording and reporting irregularities for some 2000 - 2006 programmes in Italy , Spain , France and the Netherlands . To a lesser extent , weaknesses also existed in programmes in the UK , Slovenia , Finland , Sweden and Latvia . Even if improvements have been identified in all Member States during the years 2007 - 2010 by the Commission audits , the Commission remains prudent at closure and requested all programmes authorities to report on the follow - up ( including financial corrections ) that was made at national level for all irregularities registered for each programme . The Commission will not close programmes until it assesses this information as being consistent and complete .
L12	Furthermore , the actual implementation by the Member State may not be in the same year as the Member State 's acceptance of the financial correction .

L14	MLB has a dual role , operating both as development bank and as commercial bank . At present , the bank is in the process of restructuring , i.e. it would gradually become a pure development bank while phasing out its commercial activities and would give them up completely by December 2013 at the latest . In June 2009 , Moody 's downgraded the bank 's financial strength rating to E+ ( i.e. very modest intrinsic financial strength , with a higher likelihood of periodic outside support ) which stayed the same according to the most recent available report on MLB of 22 June 2011 . Against this background , the Latvian authorities decided to intervene in MLB in the interest of financial stability . As a consequence , MLB benefitted from two recapitalisation measures in the total amount of EUR 102,48 million which were approved by the Commission on 19 November 2009 . On 23 March 2010 , Latvia implemented a third recapitalisation measure in the amount of EUR 100 million . In contrast to the approved recapitalisation measures which were attributed to the development part of the bank 's activities with a beneficial side effect on the commercial ones , the above notified measure aims at strengthening the capital base of the commercial activities of the bank . On 20 July 2010 , the third Supplemental Memorandum of Understanding ( " SMoU " ) was signed between the EU and Latvia so as to make available to Latvia medium - term financial assistance .
L15	In line with the SMoU , the elaboration of a transformation plan of the bank had been assigned to an independent advisor who was instructed to prepare scenarios on transforming the bank in order to allow for splitting off assets and liabilities related to development financing and allowing for privatisation of the bank with its commercial activities or , alternatively , transforming the bank in a way that commercial activities can be put for sale leaving the development institution behind . On 13 April 2011 , the Latvian government took a decision favouring MLB 's transformation based on the " asset sale " scenario , meaning either selling an integrated pool of commercial assets and liabilities in a large portfolio or in separate smaller bundles by end of 2011 .

L16	' Petit Épeautre de Haute Provence' enables best use to be made of the poorest soils ( known locally as ' spelt fields' ) , on which lavender is also grown . Husking takes place in artisanal workshops distributed throughout the area . A large number of mills , today no longer in use , were built along rivers and streams and also produced flour ; their millstones were put to a range of purposes . The skill lies in dedicating just the right amount of time to husking . From a historical perspective , there is evidence that ' Petit Épeautre de Haute Provence' was already present in certain prehistoric sites in Provence . The Roman occupation of ' Provincia' ( Provence ) relegated cultivation of this crop to the unromanised saltus or garrigue of the interior . After the collapse of the Roman Empire , Nordic peoples invaded Provence and caused an exodus of its population into the interior . The robust quality and storability of small spelt enabled the displaced population to survive . Small spelt was still present throughout the Middle Ages in Provence . The subsequent presence of this crop in various parts of Haute Provence is attested to in administrative acts ( 1338 ) , inquiries ( 1775 ) and agricultural statistics ( 1804 - 1874 ) .

L17	First , the General Court has erred in law in its assessment of what constitutes competition on the merits . The General Court was wrong to find that the simple exercise of a legal right under Community law tends to restrict competition . Alternatively , if the Court of Justice considers that the exercise of a right afforded by Community law could in principle amount to an abuse , then there must be something more for there to be a finding of abuse than a mere tendency to distort competition . The Appellants submit that the Commission should be required to prove that the exercise of the validly held right tended to eliminate any effective competition .

In the cases referred to in paragraph 2 ( b ) to ( f ) goods shall keep their customs status only if that status is established under the conditions and in the form prescribed by the provisions adopted in accordance with the committee procedure . Article 164 The conditions under which Community goods may move , without being subject to a customs procedure , from one point to another within the customs territory of the Community and temporarily out of that territory without alteration of their customs status shall be determined in accordance with the committee procedure . Article 165 The internal Community transit procedure shall also apply where a Community provision makes express provision for its application .

The contributions from the Members other than the Union should relate to the administrative costs of the IMI2 Joint Undertaking and , together with the contributions from the Associated Partners for their specific area of research , to the co - financing required to carry out research and innovation actions supported by the IMI2 Joint Undertaking . Participation in indirect actions funded by the IMI2 Joint Undertaking should comply with Regulation ( EU ) No 1290/2013 . The IMI2 Joint Undertaking should , moreover , ensure consistent application of those rules based on relevant measures adopted by the Commission . The IMI2 Joint Undertaking should also use electronic means managed by the Commission to ensure openness and transparency and facilitate participation . Therefore , the calls for proposals launched by the IMI2 Joint Undertaking should also be published on the single portal for participants as well as through other Horizon 2020 electronic means of dissemination managed by the Commission . Some interested parties argued that the continuation of measures will intensify job decline in the EU , certainly with regard to importers and retailers . This claim was not substantiated by the interested parties .
L34	In the light of the foregoing , I propose that the answer to the first question should be that Article 8(1 ) of Directive 2000/43 , Article 10(1 ) of Directive 2000/78 , and Article 19(1 ) of Directive 2006/54 are not to be interpreted as meaning that a job applicant must , if his application was unsuccessful , be able to force the employer to tell him whether , and on the basis of what criteria , he has engaged another applicant , even if it transpires that the unsuccessful applicant shows that he fits the required profile set out in the advertisement published by the employer .

Come on . Stop talking about erica hahn . everything all right ? Give me a minute . Okay . The interpretation of sequencing data then developed along two dimensions . The assumption was that random changes occur along all limbs of a genetic tree , but depending on the protein , only some small fraction survives . If these survival rates were constant , then distances separating existing sequences could be calculated .
L38	Most of these duplicated segments are doomed to oblivion , because any proteins their genes produce are redundant . Occasionally , however , a slightly modified gene product proves adaptively advantageous , and a new protein is born . Often its function is very similar to the old one , but occasionally a drastic change occurs . Then , in 1978 , DNA sequencing came into wide use . A second storehouse , GenBank , was established , but initially it concentrated exclusively on DNA sequences . And yet the interesting information resided in the translated DNA sequences , that is , their protein equivalents . It was one of those rare moments of opportunity when an amateur could compete with professionals . If the Parties do not reach an agreement on the compatibility of the notified measure with the provisions referred to in Article 2 within 30 days of the date of receipt of the notification , the complaining Party shall request in writing the arbitration panel to rule on the matter .

Subject to certain conditions each creditor also has the right to file a motion to stay the proceedings at the latest by the day of the vote on the compulsory settlement . Each creditor whose claim has been reduced as a result of the approval of the compulsory settlement may , within six months of the expiry of the deadline for execution of the approved settlement , request that the panel withdraw its approval of the compulsory settlement if it believes that the debtor is capable of fulfilling all its obligations as a result of an improvement in the economic and financial situation .

If the claim is secured by a material right , that must be expressly indicated on lodging the claim . Provisional measures for the purpose of security , staying the initiation of legal proceedings and prohibiting enforcement proceedings In bankruptcy proceedings , on a motion from a creditor or , exceptionally , of its own motion , the panel may , as soon as a motion to start bankruptcy proceedings is filed , issue a securing order , i.e. a provisional measure which restricts the right of the debtor 's authorised representatives to conduct legal transactions , orders payments from the debtor 's accounts to be stopped or imposes the obligation to obtain the prior approval of the panel to validate decisions taken by entities of the debtor in relation to the disposal of the debtor 's assets .

Council The Council 's productivity was systematically lower than that of the Commission and the Parliament . This can be ascribed to a combination of a high share of legislative documents requiring particular attention , highly fluctuating demand ( a daily workload from less than 1 000 to more than 7 000 pages in 2003 ) . In order to deal with its problem of overcapacity , DG A III has adopted a long - term action plan to reduce the number of translators and secretaries in the EU-15 language units from about 50 FTE in 2002 to 25 FTE in 2015 ( 33 ) . The differences between the language unit 's productivity are smaller at the Council ( and the Parliament ) than at the Commission ( with the exception of the low productivity of the English unit at DG A III which is about 20 to 40 % lower than the productivity of the other units in 2003 to 2005 ) .

Their approach does not take account of investment alternatives outside the undertaking , which any investor would examine in view of the absolute and relative value of the investment in this case . It also submits that it does not suffice that the public authorities have a shareholding in a given undertaking for any new contribution of capital to be automatically considered to be in accordance with market economy principles . A market economy investor will want to know in any event whether his overall investment , made up of the amounts already invested and the new capital contributions , allow him to obtain an appropriate return . At its 490th plenary session , held on 22 and 23 May 2013 ( meeting of 23 May ) , the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 145 votes in favour with 4 abstentions .

L57	They therefore allow for flexibility on a case - by - case basis and the authorising officer responsible may , where appropriate , decide to accept their being financed in the interests of proper implementation of programmes and projects . Such flexibility is essential for certain recurring situations where deadlock occurs because exemption mechanisms are absent or impractical ( owing , for example , to the extreme complexity of procedures in the beneficiary country ) . In these situations , the rigid formulation of the DCI and EIDHR instruments may make the action financed by external aid extremely difficult , particularly in the context of EIDHR projects .

Introduction In February 2005 the UK Government requested the EESC to produce an exploratory opinion on Ethical Trade and Consumer Assurance Schemesin the context of its Presidency of the Council from July - December 2005 and contributing to initiatives on sustainable development .
L62	' Ethical trade' , in its various forms , has been an element in a number of recent EESC opinions , notably in the field of sustainable development ( CESE 661/2004 ) and corporate social responsibility ( CESE 355/2002 ) . Fair trade in particular has long been of concern to the EESC commencing with its opinion in 1996 ( 2 ) . We therefore welcome this further opportunity to look specifically at the issue . Trade usually drives positive economic growth , wealth creation and social opportunity but can also create human and resource exploitation and environmental impact . ' Ethical trade' may offer possibilities of resolving some of these tensions . Consumers can direct the power of their consumption with significant effects ; companies are highly responsive to consumer trends and also seek to minimise risk to their reputation . The potential leverage of ' ethical trade' is substantial . Of the 100 largest economies in the world , 51 are corporations , 49 are countries ( 3 ) . As regards potential exemptions under Article 87(3 ) of the Treaty , it should first be noted that the project was not carried out in an assisted area pursuant to Article 87(3)(a ) or ( c ) of the Treaty and is thus not eligible for regional aid .
L63	Article 2 of Regulation ( EC ) No 70/2001 defines fundamental research as an activity designed to broaden scientific and technical knowledge not linked to industrial or commercial objectives . Industrial research is defined as planned research of critical investigation aimed at the acquisition of new knowledge , the objective being that such knowledge may be useful in developing new products , processes or services or in bringing about a significant improvement in existing products , processes or services . As the project in question concerns the development of a prototype and two installations which will be used in the production process , it clearly does not qualify as fundamental or industrial research . According to the same Article , a precompetitive development activity is defined as the shaping of the results of industrial research into a plan , arrangement or design for new , altered or improved products , processes or services , whether they are intended to be sold or used , including the creation of an initial prototype which could not be used commercially . This may also include the conceptual formulation and design of other products , processes or services and initial demonstration projects or pilot projects , provided that such projects can not be converted or used for industrial applications or commercial exploitation . The Commission notes that the first stage of the project consisted of the development of a prototype followed by the development of two installations which were incorporated into a production process .
L64	Look , you 're very sweet , But you should know-- I like what I do . Who thinks he can save me . In determining priorities for notifications , the Commission shall take into account whether the chemical is already listed in Part 3 of Annex I , the extent to which the information requirements laid down in Annex IV can be met , and the severity of the risks presented by the chemical , in particular for developing countries . When a chemical qualifies for PIC notification , but the information is insufficient to meet the requirements of Annex IV , identified exporters or importers shall , upon request by the Commission , provide all relevant information available to them , including that from other national or international chemical control programmes , within 60 days of the request . The applicants , Veromar di Tudisco Alfio & Salvatore Snc and the sixteen other applicants of which the names appear in the annex , shall bear their own costs and pay the costs incurred by the European Commission .

In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia - related adverse reactions ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo . Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia - related adverse reactions in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .

Weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co - morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life - style , and might lead to severe complications . Weight gain has been reported post - marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY . When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma . In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain in adults ( see section 5.1 ) . In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar mania , aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment . Weight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania . If weight gain is clinically significant , dose reduction should be considered ( see section 4.8 ) .

No starting dose adjustment was considered necessary for any of the following covariates tested . Body weight Plasma exposure ( AUCτ,ss ) was increased by 26 % for a 42 kg patient ( 2.5th percentile ) and decreased by 22 % for a 95 kg patient ( 97.5th percentile ) relative to a patient weighing 62 kg ( median body weight of patients in the overall patient population ) . Gender Female patients had a 15 % higher plasma exposure ( AUCτ,ss , body weight corrected ) than male patients . Race Race had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of afatinib based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis , including patients of Asian , White , and Black racial groups .

The extent to which EU measures actually embrace these enterprises does , however , depend to a considerable degree - and above all - on whether EU provisions can be simplified . As the proposals in respect of SMEs stand at present , the possibilities for , for example , subsidising R and D carried out by SMEs will decrease considerably , which is at variance with the need to boost the global competitiveness of these enterprises .

L76	In addition to its powers for action in emergency situations , it should therefore be entrusted with a general coordination function within the ESFS . In order to safeguard financial stability it is necessary to identify , at an early stage , trends , potential risks and vulnerabilities stemming from the micro - prudential level , across borders and across sectors . The Authority should also initiate and coordinate Union - wide stress tests to assess the resilience of financial institutions to adverse market developments , ensuring an as consistent as possible methodology is applied at the national level to such tests . In order to inform the discharge of its functions the Authority should conduct economic analyses of the markets and the impact of potential market developments . Given the globalisation of financial services and the increased importance of international standards , the Authority should represent the European Union in relation to dialogue and cooperation with supervisors in third countries . The Authority should serve as an independent advisory body to the European Parliament , the Council , and the Commission in the area of its competence . It should be able to provide its opinion on the prudential assessment of mergers and acquisitions under Directive 2006/48/EC . To avoid duplication of reporting obligations for financial institutions , that information should normally be provided by the national supervisory authorities who are closest to financial markets and institutions and take into account already existing statistics .

The court awards costs in the final decision on the substance of the case , in which , as a general rule , the losing party is obliged to pay for the costs of the successful party . Under the Act the court may , as an exception , refrain from ordering the losing party to pay the costs of the trial or to pay part of them , but may oblige the persons concerned to bear the costs immediately ( for example , if the witness , expert , or other any person not involved in the trial has to be ordered to pay the costs of an action of the trial ) . If before the decision on the substance of the case a cost arises in the proceedings that one of the parties has to bear , this cost has to be paid on the party 's behalf in advance .

Bulgaria has one of the most rapidly ageing populations in the EU , which has negative implications for the labour market , for growth potential in the economy and for the financing of its pension system . Bulgaria therefore needs to continue the reform of its pension system . Bulgaria also faces important challenges in the rationalisation and management of the hospital sector , including a lack of transparency in hospital financing and insufficiently developed services for out - patient care . Furthermore , the high level of formal and informal payments borne directly by the patient effectively excludes certain segments of the population from access to health - care .

IT actions cover the functioning and evolution of existing trans European systems and the development of new systems . The total amount to be borne by the Community 's budget is EUR 156,9 million for the 2008 - 2013 period . The 2013 programme is a six year programme aligned with the duration of the financial perspectives 2007 - 2013 . The Commission reserves itself the possibility of examining whether certain tasks of implementation of this Community programme could be entrusted to an executive agency or to service suppliers by means of technical and administrative assistance contracts .

L87	Execution on the debtor 's bank credit balances is effected by attachment and transfer : the approval for enforcement contains an order forbidding the institution where the account is held from making payment to the debtor and an order forbidding the debtor from disposing of the claim against the institution . The attachment is effected when the approval for enforcement is served on the institution where the account is held . The institution where the account is held must subsequently make a statement to the court and to the enforcing creditor as to the existence and extent of the receivable . The attached receivable is realized by being transferred . The order upholding the application for a transfer gives the enforcing creditor the right to demand payment from the third - party debtor ( the institution where the account is held ) , if necessary also by proceedings . If the bank makes payments to the account holder although the account has been attached , such payments do not have the effect of discharging its debt .

Compatibility with the common market As the notified measure constitutes State aid , it is necessary to determine if such aid is compatible with the common market under the exceptions laid down in Article 87(2 ) and 87(3 ) . None of the exceptions under Article 87(2 ) EC can be applied in this case , as the reform of the tax system is not aimed at the objectives listed in those provisions .
L90	It is also necessary to examine the measure in the light of the Guidelines for the examination of State aid to fisheries and aquaculture ( 4 ) .

For the purposes of establishing compatibility with the common market , the Court of Justice has established that the Commission is bound by the guidelines and notices that it issues in the area of supervision of State aid where they do not depart from the rules in the Treaty and are accepted by the Member States ( 5 ) . Secondly , under Article 253 EC , the Commission must give reasons for its decisions , including decisions refusing to declare aid compatible with the common market under Article 92(3)(c ) of the Treaty ( 6 ) .

In particular , the Member State must not have devalued its currency 's bilateral central rate against any other Member State 's currency on its own initiative for the same period . Since 1 January 1999 the ERM II has provided the framework for assessing the fulfilment of the exchange rate criterion . In assessing the fulfilment of this criterion in their reports , the Commission and the ECB have examined the two - year period ending 26 April 2007 . According to Article 4 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria , the criterion on the convergence of interest rates referred to in the fourth indent of Article 121(1 ) of the Treaty means that , observed over a period of one year before the examination , a Member State has had an average nominal long - term interest rate that does not exceed by more than two percentage points that of , at most , the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability . For the purpose of the criteria on the convergence of interest rates , comparable interest rates on 10-year benchmark government bonds were used .

L110	Pursuant to Article 6(6 ) of the current F4E Statutes Euratom has the right to make a reservation to a decision by the Governing Board when it considers that that decision may be contrary to Community law . In this case the decision is suspended and the matter is referred to the Commission for a review of its legality . However , the Governing Board can adopt a decision despite a Commission opinion contesting its legality . Strengthening the rights of the Commission as regards the provision on the ' reservation on legality ' would ensure consistency of the decisions of the Governing Board with the Community law in line with Article 17 of the Treaty of the European Union which states that the Commission " shall ensure the application of the Treaties , and of measures adopted by the institutions pursuant to them " .

In conclusion , notwithstanding the relevance of arguments such as the need to safeguard the proper functioning of the VAT system as a whole and not to promote anti - competitive behaviour , I consider that the finding that the exemption should be refused , leaving aside entirely the issue of its consequences in terms of integration into a criminal offence , would constitute a disproportionate response , insofar as there are other means which would allow those objectives to be achieved without a substantial breach of the principles of neutrality and territoriality .

Can I obtain legal aid to cover the costs of the procedure ? It is possible to apply for legal aid in divorce cases in accordance with the general rules on legal aid ( see ' Legal Aid - Austria' ) . Legal representation is mandatory in divorce proceedings . Is it possible to appeal against a decision relating to divorce / legal separation / marriage annulment ?
L113	Decisions by a court of the first instance on divorce or the annulment of a marriage or on the existence or non - existence of marriage are subject to appeal to the superior court , which is to say the court sitting at the provincial capital which acts as the court of the second instance for the District Court having jurisdiction . An appeal on a point of law against the judgement of the Court of Appeal is only permissible if the decision depends on the resolution of a question of substantive law or procedural law which is of considerable significance to the maintenance of the legal entity , to legal certainty or to the evolution of the law , for example because the Court of Appeal adopts a position which is at variance with Court of Justice jurisprudence , or if the latter is absent or inconsistent . What should I do to have a decision on divorce / legal separation / marriage annulment issued by a court in another Member State recognised in Austria ? Between the Member States of the European Union , with the exception of Denmark , the recognition of a decision to dissolve a marriage is based on Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1347/2000 of 29 May 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility for children of both spouses , OJ L 160 30 . 06 .

L117	The lack of that model also increases the risk of conflicts with other risk management plans . The complexity of the rules on international transfers of personal data is considered as constituting a substantial impediment to their operations as they regularly need to transfer personal data from the EU to other parts of the world . In line with its " Better Regulation " policy , the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives . The impact assessment was based on the three policy objectives of improving the internal market dimension of data protection , making the exercise of data protection rights by individuals more effective and creating a comprehensive and coherent framework covering all areas of Union competence , including police co - operation and judicial co - operation in criminal matters . Three policy options of different degrees of intervention were assessed : the first option consisted of minimal legislative amendments and the use of interpretative Communications and policy support measures such as funding programmes and technical tools ; the second option comprised a set of legislative provisions addressing each of the issues identified in the analysis and the third option was the centralisation of data protection at EU level through precise and detailed rules for all sectors and the establishment of an EU agency for monitoring and enforcement of the provisions .
L118	According to the Commission 's established methodology , each policy option was assessed , with the help of an Interservice steering group , against its effectiveness to achieve the policy objectives , its economic impact on stakeholders ( including on the budget of the EU institutions ) , its social impact and effect on fundamental rights . Environmental impacts were not observed .

The Commission subsequently identified those product types sold domestically by the companies having overall representative sales which were identical or directly comparable with the types sold for export to the Union . For each product type sold by the exporting producers concerned on the domestic market , which was found to be directly comparable with the type sold for export to the Union , it was established whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2 ) of the basic Regulation . Domestic sales of a particular product type were considered as sufficiently representative when the volume of that product type sold on the domestic market to independent customers during the IP represented 5 % or more of the total volume of the comparable product type sold for export to the Union .
L122	Where the volume of profitable sales of a product type represented 80 % , or less of the total sales volume of that product type , or where the weighted average price of that type was below the unit cots , normal value was based on the actual domestic price , which was calculated as the weighted average price of only the profitable domestic sales of the type in question . Where the product types were all sold at a loss , it was considered that they were not sold in the ordinary course of trade . For sales of product types not made in the ordinary course of trade , as well as for product types which were not sold in representative quantities on the domestic market , the Commission used constructed normal value , in accordance with Article 2(3 ) of the basic Regulation . Implementing Regulation ( EU ) No 543/2011 lays down , pursuant to the outcome of the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations , the criteria whereby the Commission fixes the standard values for imports from third countries , in respect of the products and periods stipulated in Annex XVI , Part A thereto . The standard import value is calculated each working day , in accordance with Article 136(1 ) of Implementing Regulation ( EU ) No 543/2011 , taking into account variable daily data .

Subject : Workplace deaths in Marghera Answer from the Commission ( 28 February 2008 ) For these reasons I propose that Question 2 be answered in the sense that Article 17 of Regulation No 1371/2007 is to be interpreted as meaning that a railway undertaking may not exclude its obligation to pay compensation of the ticket price in cases of force majeure . In Question 1 the Verwaltungsgerichtshof asks whether Article 30(1 ) of Regulation No 1371/2007 is to be interpreted as meaning that the national body designated responsible for the enforcement of that regulation may prescribe , with binding effect on a railway undertaking whose compensation terms do not conform to the criteria laid down in Article 17 of that regulation , the specific content of the compensation terms to be used by that railway undertaking , when national law permits that body only to declare such compensation terms null and void .

Since the activity of rescue workers in an emergency medical assistance service is not included among the exclusions laid down , Article 1(3 ) of Directive 93/104 and Article 2 of Directive 89/391 must be construed as meaning that such activity falls within the scope of both directives . B - The second part of the first question 29 . The Arbeitsgericht goes on to consider the concept of road transport in Article 1(3 ) of Directive 93/104 , in so far as it is excluded from the scope of the directive , in order to ascertain whether that sector includes the activity of an emergency rescue service which consists , at least in part , of driving vehicles and attending to patients during the journey .

Under Maltese Procedural Law , an admission , in writing or otherwise , done before the court or some place else , is admissible as evidence against the person making such admission . An admission made upon a reference to the oath of one of the parties may be received in evidence of a fact even against the other parties to the suit . In all cases , only such part of an admission as the court may deem worthy of credit shall constitute evidence . To what extent must the court be convinced of a fact in order to base its judgment on the existence of that fact ?
L128	In civil cases , the Courts examine the evidence produced , with a view to determine which fact occurred according to the claim / defence brought forward . In criminal cases , the Courts need to ascertain whether the proof brought forward , beyond reasonable doubt attributes guilt to the person charged or accused . II . Does the taking of evidence always require the application of a party , or can the judge in certain cases also take evidence on his own motion ? This writ must contain in detail the claims being brought forward by the claimant , a declaration by the same claimant on oath ascertaining the facts alleged , and also a list of witnesses and documents to be brought forward in support of the claims made , identifying in the process the exact scope , bearing and actual use of bringing forward such evidence . The defendant , upon answering to the writ of summons served on him , shall also identify all the evidence that he shall bring forward in support of his position . The same Procedural Code , stipulates that should a witness not be mentioned at this stage , i.e. prior to the actual pleadings before Court , no further evidence can be brought forward , unless authorisation is given by the Court hearing the case .

It claims that it is necessary to appraise the duration of the illicit practice at issue in light of the Commission 's negligence , which led JCB Service reasonably to believe that its distribution network did not infringe competition rules . 223 That argument is entirely irrelevant . It should be observed that the Commission 's assessment of the duration of the infringement found concerns agreements and practices which were not notified . 224 In that regard , JCB Service maintains that there is simply no evidence to support a finding that the alleged infringements were conducted over a period of 10 years .
L130	225 It should be noted that , in its complaint , JCB Service confines itself in essence to criticising the Court of First Instance for not setting out or citing all the evidence enabling the duration of the infringement to be established . However , it does not show that the Court erred in law in paragraph 184 by endorsing the Commission 's findings in relation to the infringement 's duration . JCB Service has not in fact advanced any argument to show that the Commission 's assessment in this regard departs from Section 1B of the Guidelines . That argument must therefore be dismissed . 226 Finally , JCB Service submits that the Court failed to take into account in the present case the existence of attenuating circumstances within the meaning of Section 3 of the Guidelines . Next , JCB Service did not implement the illicit practice in Italy which it is alleged to have pursued . This can increase our sentences ! No way ! I 'm out of this ! Guard ! Mister !

L133	Legal act - an official written document adopted by competent State institutions under which legal provisions are consolidated and explained or which specifies the basis on which legal provisions are applicable in each individual case . The following are the different types of legal act according to the nature of the legal information laid down in them : Regulatory legal acts are divided into two groups : Laws - legal acts bearing the greatest legal force , adopted by the Parliament ( Seimas ) of the Republic of Lithuania or by national referendum , setting out general legal provisions aimed at regulating the principal human relations , and representing the highest level of legal force . Secondary acts can not contradict a law . Individual acts have legal implications similar to regulatory legal acts , but they are not granted the status of sources of law since they do not establish commonly applicable rules of a general nature , and the provisions incorporated in them are aimed at specific persons in specific cases and are applicable only once , that is , they are valid only until the social circumstances to which they relate cease to exist ( appointment to a post , warning , award of a pension etc . ) . Other sources of law In addition to regulatory legal acts , the following are also classified as primary sources of law :

The rule in Article 5(3 ) of Regulation No 615/98 that the refund is not to be paid to an exporter where that directive has not been ' complied with' does not refer , in contrast to the provisions of Article 33(5 ) of Regulation No 3665/87 , to the absence of the quid pro quo in return for which the ' refund' is made available but , rather , imposes a measure on an exporter who brings himself within the scope of the penalties which Article 18 of that directive required the Member States to adopt and which the Community brought into being as it acquired greater experience in that area and the feeling emerged that it should take a more effective part in the protection of animals .

In its answer the Court is requested to clarify what relevance it has to the assessment whether the rebate scheme 's thresholds are set in such a way that the rebate scheme applies to the majority of customers on the market .
L145	At the same time the Court is requested to clarify what relevance the characteristics of the market have in this connection , including whether the characteristics of the market can justify the foreclosure effect being demonstrated by examinations and analyses other than a ' competitor as efficient' test ( see , in that regard , paragraph 24 of the Commission 's communication on the application of Article 82 ) . How probable and serious must the anti - competitive effect of a rebate scheme having the characteristics referred to in points 10 and 11 of the order for reference be for Article 82 of the EC Treaty to apply ? Having regard to the answers given to Questions 1 and 2 , what specific circumstances must the national court take into account in assessing whether a rebate scheme , in circumstances such as those described in the order for reference ( characteristics of the market and the rebate scheme ) , has or is capable of having such a foreclosure effect in the specific case that it constitutes an abuse covered by Article 82 of the EC Treaty ? In this connection , is it a requirement that the foreclosure effect is appreciable ? Drop dead ! Cunt ! Do you think I do that out , for you ? Hey , come on down . Come on , get down .

The Court can not sensibly propose exhaustive criteria for the national authorities to apply .

L152	In that respect , a serviceman flying or crewing an aircraft or helicopter that aims a missile at , or machine - guns a column of , civilian refugees is clearly closer in the chain of events to the commission of a war crime than the person who armed the aircraft or helicopter and ensured that it was combat ready .

' Thus , by making two separate requests for the installation allowance , the first on 9 September 1997 enabling him to obtain one month 's salary by producing his lease agreement and the second in March 1998 enabling him to obtain payment of the second half of that allowance by producing the application for residence permits for the members of his family , the applicant sought to give his administration the impression , in line with what he had initially stated on 1 September 1997 , that his family had not yet joined him at his new place of employment , which was incorrect , and that the family did not join him until 2 March 1998 , which was also incorrect .
L154	However , when questioned about this he replied that he had not challenged the payment by the appointing authority in September 1997 of only one month 's salary under Article 5(4 ) of Annex VII , which does indeed confirm that the applicant had taken care , by dividing his request for an installation allowance into two requests , to give to his administration the impression that his statements that his family did not take up residence until 2 March 1998 - the day after the last date for payment of the daily subsistence allowance provided for in his case - were true . He also provided , as he himself acknowledges , ' so that he could thereby claim in good faith ... the daily subsistence allowance' , an invoice relating to a move which allegedly took place on 2 March 1998 , the authenticity of which was called into question both by OLAF and by the Commission . 76 It is clear from the above considerations that , both in connection with his two requests for the installation allowance and with his request for reimbursement of his removal costs , the applicant deliberately provided his administration with incorrect information regarding the date on which his family took up residence at his new place of employment and proceeded in such a way that the administration was misled by the applicant 's actions and was therefore unable to detect itself that payment of the daily subsistence allowance at issue was undue .

As we clung to the lee rail and worked our way aft , I happened to glance to leeward . It was painted black , and from the talk of the hunters of their poaching exploits I recognized it as a United States revenue cutter . I pointed it out to Maud and hurriedly led her aft to the safety of the poop . I started to rush below to the flag - locker , then remembered that in rigging the Ghost . " We need no distress signal , " Maud said . " They have only to see us . " " We are saved , " I said , soberly and solemnly . Ooh ! Wait , wait , wait , wait . Oh , my god ! Ah , darn !

However , the reference for a preliminary ruling does not concern the first and second conditions laid down in Article 5(1 ) of that directive , since the Court has already ruled on those conditions at paragraphs 61 to 71 of the judgment in Infopaq International .
L175	Questions 1 and 2 relating to the condition that the acts of reproduction must constitute an integral and essential part of a technological process 29 By its first and second questions , which should be considered together , the referring court asks , in essence , whether Article 5(1 ) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the acts of reproduction carried out during a data capture process , such as those in issue in the main proceedings , fulfil the condition that those acts must constitute an integral and essential part of a technological process . In that regard , the referring court asks in particular whether the stage of the technological process at which those acts took place and the fact that that technological process involves human intervention should be taken into account . 30 The concept of the ' integral and essential part of a technological process' requires the temporary acts of reproduction to be carried out entirely in the context of the implementation of the technological process and , therefore , not to be carried out , fully or partially , outside of such a process . This concept also assumes that the completion of the temporary act of reproduction is necessary , in that the technological process concerned could not function correctly and efficiently without that act ( see , to that effect , Infopaq International , paragraph 61 ) .
L176	33 In the present case , it should be recalled that the technological process in question consists of carrying out electronic and automatic research in newspaper articles and identifying and extracting predefined key words from those articles , in order to render the drafting of summaries of newspaper articles more efficient . 34 In that context , there are three successive acts of reproduction involved . They materialise through the creation of the TIFF file , then that of the text file and , finally , through that of the file containing the extract of 11 words . 35 In that context , first , it is not in dispute that none of those acts are completed outside of that technological process . 36 Secondly , in the light of the considerations set out at paragraphs 30 to 32 of the present order , it is irrelevant that such a technological process is activated by the manual insertion of newspaper articles into a scanner , in order to achieve a first temporary reproduction - the creation of a TIFF file - and that it is terminated by an act of temporary reproduction , namely the creation of a file containing an extract of 11 words .

Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions have been reported for fluoroquinolones including moxifloxacin after first administration . In these cases moxifloxacin should be discontinued and suitable treatment ( e.g. treatment for shock ) initiated . Moxifloxacin has been shown to prolong the QTc interval on the electrocardiogram in some patients . In the analysis of ECGs obtained in the clinical trial program , QTc prolongation with moxifloxacin was 6 msec ± 26 msec , 1.4 % compared to baseline . Medication that can reduce potassium levels should be used with caution in patients receiving moxifloxacin .
L205	Moxifloxacin should be used with caution in patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions , such as acute myocardial ischaemia or QT prolongation as this may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias ( incl . torsade de pointes ) and cardiac arrest ( see also section 4.3 ) .

But the second woman made a violent grab for her veiled companion , yanking the gentlewoman back into her seat . Mallory , still holding the leather harness , stared in astonishment .

It was a blow both calculated and covert , jabbing her doubled knuckles into the woman 's short ribs with a practiced viciousness . The veiled woman doubled over and collapsed back into her seat .
L210	He dashed to the side of the brougham and yanked open the lacquered door . " What is the meaning of this ? " he shouted . " Go away , " the tart suggested . " I saw you strike this lady .

They serve as important indicators for the management of monetary policy . Very considerable progress has been made in harmonizing methodologies since the initial implementing measures were adopted , but scope for non - comparability remains with regard to sampling , replacement , quality adjustment and aggregation procedures . The existing HICP framework provides a definition of the HICP as a Laspeyres - type index concerned with the changing power of money to acquire goods and services for the purposes of directly satisfying consumer needs .
L211	The notion of consumption segments by purpose is therefore central to sampling and to the meaning of quality change and quality adjustment . However , an ambiguity in this concept concerns the level of aggregation at which it is defined and applied . The range of product - offers will change over time as products are modified or replaced by retailers and manufacturers . The HICP requires the representation of all currently available product - offers within the consumption segments by purpose selected in the reference period in order to measure their impact on inflation .

L214	Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities Given the high risk environment in external actions , systems need to anticipate a significant occurrence of potential compliance errors ( irregularities ) in transactions and build in a high level of prevention , detection and correction controls as early as possible in the payment process . This means in practice that compliance controls will place most reliance on significant ex - ante checks on a multi - annual basis by both external auditors and Commission staff in the field before final project payments ( while still executing some ex - post audits and checks ) , going well beyond the financial safeguards required by the Financial Regulation .

Its very special reputation is borne out by the fact that some two million ' Stollen' manufactured in the geographical area are sold around the world every year .

Compatibility with financial programming and financial perspective [ X ] Proposal is compatible with existing financial programming . Proposal will entail reprogramming of the relevant heading in the financial perspective . Proposal may require application of the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement . 107 The Commission also submits that , in accordance with Paragraph 6 of the Bgld ArtenschutzVO , that regulation does not affect fishing and hunting . Paragraph 6 thus allows deliberate damage to nests and to reproduction , resting and wintering areas of protected species . 108 The Republic of Austria explains that the provincial legislature adopted derogating provisions because of significant damage caused by the European starling to vines . 109 It submits that protection of that species is ensured at all stages of its development , including the egg stage .
L216	So far as concerns Paragraph 6 of the Bgld ArtenschutzVO , its final sentence can not be interpreted as establishing a general derogation for hunting and fishing . Findings of the Court 110 The general system of protection established in Article 5 of the Directive extends , as its introductory wording states , to all species of birds referred to in Article 1 of the Directive . That system includes , inter alia , a prohibition on deliberately killing , capturing or disturbing birds of protected species . 111 As has been found in paragraphs 90 and 91 of the present judgment , the fact that between 15 July and 30 November the European starling is entirely excluded from the system of protection envisaged by the Directive is incompatible with Article 1 of the Directive . 112 Consequently , the action authorised by the provisions referred to in paragraph 106 of the present judgment is likewise incompatible with the prohibitions set out in Article 5 of the Directive . 114 However , that provision does not provide a legal basis for a species being entirely removed - even if the removal is temporally limited - from the system of protection laid down by the Directive . 115 Removing a species of bird entirely from the system of protection laid down by the Directive , even for a defined period , could jeopardise the very existence of that species .
L217	Thus , the Member States are authorised to derogate from the system of protection for wild birds only if they observe the requirements set out in Article 9(2 ) of the Directive . 117 In the contested legislation it is prohibited , under Paragraph 16(4 ) of the Bgld NSchLPflG , to pursue , disturb , capture , transport , hold , injure , kill , keep or take away protected animals . information .

Combining telmisartan with ramipril did not add further benefit over ramipril or telmisartan alone . In addition , there was a significantly higher incidence of hyperkalaemia , renal failure , hypotension and syncope in the combination arm . Therefore the use of a combination of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended in this population . It is not that people are completely dishonest . On the contrary , they typically pride themselves on integrity . It 's just that their integrity suffers little lapses here and there - and not always so little in aggregate . The economic equilibrium we live should be regarded , above all , as a phishing equilibrium , in which small - time individual dishonesty can morph into something more systemically important when it is carried on by business organizations under intense competitive pressure . But it also often compels them to keep the frontiers of subtle deception in view . The SEC 's new rules for crowdfunding are complex , because they address a complicated problem .

L233	In a number of Member States , an internal reform process has also begun , which reinforces the intervention of regional legislative assemblies in the mechanisms advocated in the Protocol on the Application of the Principles of Subsidiarity and Proportionality of the Treaty of Lisbon so that they can act as a component part of the parliamentary mechanism in their country or as chambers of the national parliament . This approach should be extended , in accordance with national constitutional structures . Furthermore , the capacity of local and regional authorities to understand Community law must be strengthened in order to reinforce legal certainty within the European Union and facilitate the correct transposition of Community legislation . The difficulties encountered during the transposition of the Directives on landfill of waste ( 30 ) and award of public works contracts , public supply contracts and public service contracts ( 31 ) are important examples of the need to involve local and regional authorities throughout the process of formulating Community legislation ( 32 ) . Impact assessments of draft legislation are a key tool for achieving better Community legislation . An impact assessment must pay attention to the implementation and maintenance of regulations . It is very important here that the territorial aspect of new legislation should have a key position in the Commission 's current impact assessments . If I translated correctly .

CAUSATION ( a ) Introduction In order to reach its conclusions on the cause of injury faced by the Community industry and in accordance with Article 3(6 ) and ( 7 ) of the basic Regulation , the Commission examined the impact of all known factors and their consequences on the situation in that industry . Known factors other than the dumped imports , which at the same time could be injuring the Community industry , were also examined to ensure that the possible injury caused by these other factors was not attributed to the dumped imports . ( b ) Effects of the dumped imports Over the period under examination , dumped imports from the PRC increased considerably in volume ( 47 % ) and in market share ( from 21,0 % in 2000 to 31,1 % in the IP ) . Moreover , they exerted a pressure , which forced the Community industry to maintain its own prices practically stable , in spite of the substantial increase in the cost of raw materials .

Specific comments 5.1 Proactive work is being done on a ' toolbox' with a view to application of the IMO decision to apply a 0,1 % sulphur limit value to marine fuel in SECAs from 2015 . There is no information on availability . 5.2 The use of emission reduction methods ( scrubbers / washers ) is being tested in various pilot projects . Significant advances are being made with on - board scrubbers already operational . With the simultaneous removal of NO 2 and CO 2 such equipment may prove its cost - effectiveness in the near future and needs to be kept under consideration . 78 Those pleadings are drafted exclusively for the purposes of the court proceedings , in which they play the key role . It is by means of the application initiating proceedings that the applicant defines the parameters of the dispute and it is , in particular , during the written procedure - the oral procedure not being obligatory - that the parties provide the Court with the information on the basis of which it is to adjudicate .
L258	79 It is clear , both from the wording of the relevant provisions of the Treaties and from the broad logic of Regulation No 1049/2001 and the objectives of the relevant EU rules , that judicial activities are as such excluded from the scope , established by those rules , of the right of access to documents . 80 As regards , first , the relevant provisions of the Treaties , it is quite clear from the wording of Article 255 EC that the Court is not subject to the obligations of transparency laid down in that provision . 81 The purpose of that exclusion emerges even more clearly from Article 15 TFEU , which replaced Article 255 EC and which , while extending the scope of the principle of transparency , specifies - in the fourth subparagraph of paragraph 3 thereof - that the Court of Justice is to be subject to paragraph 3 only when exercising its administrative tasks . 82 It follows that the fact that the Court of Justice is not among the institutions which , in accordance with Article 255 EC , are subject to those obligations is justified precisely because of the nature of the judicial responsibilities which it is called upon to discharge under Article 220 EC .
L259	85 In that regard , it should be noted that the protection of court proceedings implies , in particular , that compliance with the principles of equality of arms and the sound administration of justice must be ensured . 86 With regard , first , to equality of arms , it should be noted that - as the General Court pointed out , in substance , in paragraph 78 of the judgment under appeal - if the content of the Commission 's pleadings were to be open to public debate , there would be a danger that the criticism levelled against them , whatever its actual legal significance , might influence the position defended by the Commission before the EU Courts . 87 In addition , such a situation could well upset the vital balance between the parties to a dispute before those Courts - the state of balance which is at the basis of the principle of equality of arms - since only the institution concerned by an application for access to its documents , and not all the parties to the proceedings , would be bound by the obligation of disclosure .

L262	It will therefore be difficult to improve the innovation and competitiveness of the European sector . The European aquaculture profession has recently established the European Aquaculture Technology and Innovation Platform , with the aim of defining priorities for the sector with respect to RDI , and providing a strategic vision in order to achieve these . 4.11.1 The search should continue for alternative , safe , sustainable ingredients that still meet the nutritional and biological requirements of fish while ensuring that the end product offers the same nutritional benefits . 4.11.2 Efforts should be maintained to optimise current production systems , particularly those with clear possibilities for future expansion such as offshore sea aquaculture and inland recirculation systems . 4.12 The availability of veterinary medicinal products is a major hindrance to the development of aquaculture . At the moment , European aquaculture does not have sufficient veterinary products such as anaesthetics , vaccines or antibiotics . 4.13 The Commission 's communication proposes supporting the export of aquaculture production technology to third countries . Although this initiative shows a degree of solidarity that should clearly be supported , it is important to consider that the aquaculture products resulting from this exported technology may end up being imported into the EU where they will compete with European production . 4.14 The Commission communication accurately describes the causes of the current stagnation of aquaculture in the EU .
L263	However , it should not be considered as a completed work but , rather , as a starting point for designing and implementing specific actions to revive the sustainable development of aquaculture in the EU .

When such a period is expressed in months or years , the starting point is determined in the same way , i.e. the period begins to run from the day following the date of service , notification or the relevant event that sets it in train . Are there any starting points for time limits which apply exceptionally or particularly in certain civil procedures ? A period expressed in weeks , months or years and starting from a certain date ends at 24.00 ( midnight ) of the corresponding day in the last week , month or year but , if the corresponding day does not exist in the last month , the period ends on the last day of that month ( Article 279(c ) of the Civil Code ) . If the period expires on a Saturday , Sunday or a public holiday or non - working day , is it extended until the first following working day ? Is this extension applicable even when the period in question has as a starting point a future event ? The courts are only open on working days .

In accordance with Section 3 of the Customs Act , the federal AD should be ' equal' to the excise duty levied on domestic products . The Additional Duty is charged on an ad valorem basis at distinct rates .

L280	' Our two cavalry units were riding too close together . Not applicable . 6.3 Shelf life 24 months . Generally speaking , the availability and quality of the labour cost index ( LCI ) continued to improve . National quality reports were increasingly provided on time and almost all Member States now report the metadata on a quarterly basis , explaining changes in the data and providing useful background information . One of the areas that have received more attention during the last two years is the coherence of the Labour Cost Index with other Labour Cost statistics , with a particular focus on quarterly national accounts data . Coherence has been analysed from both a theoretical and an empirical point of view and the results have been discussed with the Member States . Feedback from users on this innovation was very positive . Member States were involved in the process and experiences relating to this exercise were shared . Despite these positive developments , there are still a number of issues which require further efforts by certain Member States in order to complete the harmonisation process . These issues are discussed below . These processes , which became fully operational in 2005 , are continuously reviewed and updated . You okay ? I think I have dirt in my mouth .

Conclusion on injury Certain injury indicators , such as sales prices ( + 14 % ) , production capacity ( + 6 % ) and investments ( + 35 % ) show a positive trend during the period considered .
L282	In addition , the injury indicators related to the financial performance of the Community industry such as cash flow ( - 47 % ) , return on investment ( - 32 % ) and profitability ( - 7,5 percentage points ) were seriously affected . This means that the ability of the Community industry to raise capital was also undermined . The investigation also showed that the costs of production of the Community industry significantly increased during the period considered , mainly due to the sharp increase in the prices of scrap ( + 34 % ) which is the main raw material for the production of wire rod . However , in view of the undercutting practiced by the Chinese and Moldovan exporters during the IP , the Community industry could not increase its sales prices in line with the increased raw material prices . Based on the above , although the Community industry remained profitable during the IP by focusing on higher - end market segments with higher prices , its financial situation significantly deteriorated . In the light of the foregoing , it was concluded that the Community industry suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 3(5 ) of the basic Regulation .

To this day , the Brewing Technology Faculty of the Technische Universität München - Weihenstephan and the Doemens Institute are the leading training institutions for brewers and brewing engineers who go on to work in all parts of the world . The renown and reputation of ' Münchner Bier' have , as we have seen , grown continuously in Germany and other EU Member States over the last 550 years .

The ' Oktoberfest' , as the festival of ' Münchner Bier' , is known throughout the world . Its procession of festival goers in traditional regional and military costume , its opening ceremony and the daily reporting from the ' Oktoberfest' tents have made ' Münchner Bier' a household name . Sports sponsorship , e.g. of the German national bobsleigh team or in the ' Olympiahalle' arena , has displayed the name of ' Münchner Bier' on television sets across the world . In recent decades , radio , television and especially the Internet have introduced more and more people from many different countries to ' Münchner Bier' , a beverage avidly discussed in online forums and fan clubs .

The referring court states , first , that neither the Paediatric Regulation nor Regulation No 469/2009 expressly provided for the possibility of granting such SPCs and that that solution would run counter to the normal meaning of the word ' duration' in Article 13 of Regulation No 469/2009 . 37 . It states , secondly , that Article 13 does not form part of the conditions for granting an SPC and that granting an SPC with a negative or zero duration would be consistent with the objective pursued by the Paediatric Regulation . It points out that , if that interpretation were to prevail , it would also be necessary to clarify the starting point of the extension of the SPC .
L320	There would thus be a need to ascertain whether the six - month period must begin to run before the date of expiry of the patent , on the date established by assigning a negative value to the SPC , or whether that value must be rounded up to zero and the six - month period made to run from the date of expiry of the patent .

L324	At the moment , only 2 % of European citizens feel that biological invasions are important threats to biodiversity . Communication and education activities should build a sense of responsibility amongst European citizens , authorities and industries with regard to the potential threats of trade in and movement of potential IS . If these communication and education activities are not limited to the threat to biodiversity but also highlight the other dangers - to public health , to agriculture - people may become less reluctant towards new legislation and the establishment of a new European Agency , especially when it becomes clear that doing nothing will be much more expensive in the long term than acting now . And the sooner adequate action is taken , the lower the overall costs will be . 6.5 Social aspects 6.5.1 The EESC suggests that the Commission examines all existing tools and legislation to tackle IS and their harmful social side effects . The example of the gasification of containers that are shipped to Europe from other continents , to ensure that they arrive uncontaminated in European ports , illustrates these side - effects . 6.5.2 There are several ways to ensure that containers arrive uncontaminated in EU ports . 6.5.3 Gasified containers need considerable time to degasify before they are safe to enter . 2009/C 81/04 On 10 March 2009 , the Commission decided not to oppose the above notified concentration and to declare it compatible with the common market .

That fact puts the Commission 's argument into its context because , contrary to what the Commission says , on the basis of the data received , it was able to ask the Greek authorities to determine , for each nome , the areas incorrectly regularised and the aid which had been paid in the context of the COM wine for those areas or , at least , the total aid paid in that connection for each nome .
L326	188 It follows from paragraphs 182 to 187 above that , in the accounts clearance procedure , the Commission did not seek to evaluate the expenditure financed by the Funds as a result of the irregularities found whereas , contrary to the Commission 's submissions , the financial consequences were not necessarily impossible to calculate . 189 Therefore the Commission 's second objection must be dismissed . 190 Third , the Commission submits that the method of calculating the financial correction based on the value of planting rights is appropriate , as the flat - rate amount compensating for the losses which the Funds will suffer can be taken from the value of the planting rights which is used to calculate the regularisation fee .

Robert , that 's good lip tension , The questions 24 By its two questions , the Consiglio di Stato asks , in essence , whether Article 11 of Directive 97/13 precludes a national provision , such as that at issue in the main proceedings , which requires a company holding an individual licence for the provision of a public telecommunications network , for which it has paid a fee as provided for in that article , to pay an additional fee in respect of the private use of that network .
L330	25 The Italian Government argues that Directive 97/13 does not apply to private telecommunication networks or services , but only to public telecommunication networks or services . 26 The Court finds in that respect that , according to Article 1(1 ) of Directive 97/13 , the latter concerns the procedures for granting authorisations for the purposes of providing telecommunication services , without making any distinction between networks open to the public and private networks . 27 In addition , Article 7(2 ) of that directive authorises Member States to enact a system of individual licences for the establishment and provision of public telecommunication networks as well as other networks involving the use of radio frequencies . 29 According to the referring court , the network at issue in the main proceedings has been opened to the public by virtue of the individual licence authorising NST to provide a public telecommunication network , in accordance with Article 7(2 ) of Directive 97/13 . THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION , Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community , and in particular Article 95 thereof , Having regard to the proposal from the Commission , Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ) , Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty ( 2 ) , Whereas :
L331	In its Resolution of 18 February 1986 on common measures to reduce road accidents , as part of the Community 's programme for road safety ( 3 ) , the European Parliament stressed the need for making the wearing of safety belts compulsory for all passengers , including children , except in public service vehicles . Therefore , a distinction has to be made between public service buses and other vehicles as regards the compulsory installation of safety belts and/or restraint systems . Pursuant to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type - approval of motor vehicles and their trailers ( 4 ) , the Community type - approval system has only been implemented for all new vehicles of category M 1 since 1 January 1998 . Consequently , only these vehicles have to be fitted with anchorages intended for safety belts and/or restraint systems fulfilling the provisions of Directive 76/115/EEC ( 5 ) . Until the Community type - approval system is extended to all categories of vehicles , the installation of anchorages intended for safety belts and/or restraint systems should be required , in the interests of road safety , in vehicles belonging to categories other than M 1 . Directive 76/115/EEC already provides for all technical and administrative provisions allowing the type - approval of vehicles of categories other than M 1 .
L332	Manufacturers and their suppliers have thus developed appropriate technology . Directive 76/115/EEC should be amended accordingly . Since the objective of this Directive , namely the improvement of road safety by the introduction of the compulsory fitting of safety belts in certain categories of vehicles , can not be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore , by reason of the scale of the action , be better achieved at Community level , the Community may adopt measures , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty .

L333	The relationship is based on a long - term Obligation on PI and the Treasury . The constraints on PI as depositor incorporate implicit costs and burdens : The deposit at the Treasury can not be considered a short - term risk - free asset , in view of PI 's permanent obligation to keep its money with the Treasury . The yield on the deposit reflects that long - term obligation by paying for the implicit long - term risk of the Italian Republic , which is estimated in an extra return of 0,30 % ( equal to the market spread paid by long - term government bonds over money market rates ) . PI is prevented from engaging in active fund management strategies ( the quantitative analysis conducted by [ ... ] is aimed at establishing the burdens this imposes ) . ( ii ) The cost to PI of collecting deposits from retail customers is in line with the cost of retail deposits to private - sector banks , as the Commission has acknowledged . In fact the interest margin achieved by private - sector banks on the component deriving from deposits with their own networks is significantly higher that PI 's ( 4,7 % in 2006 , as opposed to 3,75 % for PI , and 4,6 % in 2005 , as opposed to 3 % ) .

EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM - Purpose The purpose of this Commission proposal is to amend Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 3922/91 on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation[1 ] to align it with Council Decision No 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [ 2 ] , as last amended by Council Decision No 2006/512/EC of 17 July 2006[3 ] . - Background Decision No 2006/512/EC introduced a new type of procedure for the exercise of implementing powers , the regulatory procedure with scrutiny . The regulatory procedure with scrutiny must now be followed for measures of general scope which seek to amend non - essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty , inter alia by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument by the addition of new non - essential elements .
L366	In particular , this new regulatory procedure must be followed when the annexes to a basic instrument are deleted , amended or replaced or are adapted to scientific and technical progress . Since this Decision applies immediately from its entry into force on 23 July 2006 , all legal instruments containing a regulatory procedure must be amended . - Content Article 8(1 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) and Article 11 of Regulation ( EC ) No 3922/91 authorise the Commission to delete , amend or adapt the common rules in Annex III using the regulatory procedure . Therefore that Regulation should be amended to provide for the adoption of these implementing measures using the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny . Decision 2006/512/EC also provides that in cases where , on imperative grounds of urgency , the time - limits normally applicable under the regulatory procedure with scrutiny can not be complied with , the Commission may apply the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6 ) of the above Decision . Therefore this procedure is proposed as an alternative to Article 8(1 ) , last subparagraph , and Article 11(1 ) . Given the urgent need for alignment with the new rules on comitology regarding instruments at the final stage of the legislative procedure , this Regulation must be adopted by the Parliament and the Council before the end of 2006 .

Lens Distortion REGIONS OF KNOWLEDGE Objectives Strengthening the research potential of European regions , in particular by encouraging and supporting the development , across Europe , of regional " research - driven clusters " associating regional authorities , universities , research centres , enterprises and other relevant stakeholders . Regions are increasingly recognised as important players in the EU 's research and development landscape . At the same time evidence indicates that investment in R&D improves regional attractiveness while increasing competitiveness of local businesses . R&D intensive clusters rang among the best drivers of such investment activity resulting in direct gains in local competitive advantage with beneficial effects in terms of growth and jobs .
L368	The 2003 Pilot Action Regions of Knowledge[19 ] confirmed the importance of such clusters and the interest to support and encourage their development . This action will enable European regions to strengthen their capacity for investing in RTD , while maximising their potential for a successful involvement of their stakeholders in European research projects . " Regions of Knowledge " aims at supporting the definition and implementation of optimal policies and strategies for the development of R&D driven clusters . In particular it will improve the relevance and effectiveness of regional research agendas through mutual learning ; promote and strengthen cooperation between clusters ; and contribute to strengthening the sustainable development of existing R&D driven clusters as well as foster the creation of new ones . Support will be provided in particular for demand - driven and problem - oriented projects addressing specific technological areas or sectors[20 ] . This action will apply to all regions , including Convergence[21 ] ones .

Price statistics for deflating market output should reflect the total price of the product , not only the consumer 's contribution towards the total price or a conventional tariff price .

Applications received by number of workers targeted for assistance The total number of workers targeted by the measures proposed for co - financing by the EGF was 10 403 , which is around 74 % of the total number of workers made redundant ( around 14 000 redundancies were declared by the nine Member States in the eleven applications submitted ) . The numbers ranged from 295 to 2 103 targeted workers , with five applications targeting more than 1 000 and two applications targeting fewer than 500 workers . The number of workers affected by a redundancy event and the number targeted for EGF support can differ , because the applicant Member State may decide to focus the EGF assistance only on specific groups of workers , such as those facing exceptional difficulties in staying in the labour market and/or those most in need of assistance . Some of the affected workers may receive assistance outside the EGF , while others may find new jobs on their own or may decide to take early retirement , which means that they would not be targeted for EGF measures .

L385	A foreign currency transaction shall be recorded , on initial recognition in the functional currency , by applying to the foreign currency amount the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction . The date of a transaction is the date on which the transaction first qualifies for recognition in accordance with international financial reporting standards . For practical reasons , a rate that approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction is often used , for example , an average rate for a week or a month might be used for all transactions in each foreign currency occurring during that period . However , if exchange rates fluctuate significantly , the use of the average rate for a period is inappropriate . ( a ) foreign currency monetary items shall be translated using the closing rate ; Whether the carrying amount is determined on the basis of historical cost or on the basis of fair value , if the amount is determined in a foreign currency it is then translated into the functional currency in accordance with this standard .

Dinin dismounted , leaving his lizard clinging comfortably to a wall at his chest level .

Dinin took a deep breath and gingerly stepped to the arch- way . He could see the spiders leering down at him from their fifteen - foot height . Dinin had heard that the spiders often refused entry - viciously- even to uninvited drow . His business was of the utmost impor- tance to his family 's battle plans .

The latter was the eternal , living principle or soul in him ; and in sleep , being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind , which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent , it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing , of which , for the time , it was no longer an integral . But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul , therefore it must have been that , in Ahab 's case , yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose ; that purpose , by its own sheer inveteracy of will , forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self - assumed , independent being of its own .

This right includes the competence to take measures to protect the integrity of euro banknotes as a means of payment . The Union 's environmental policy is based on the principle of environmental integration , as laid down in Article 11 of the Treaty , according to which environmental protection requirements must be integrated into the definition and implementation of the Union 's policies and activities , in particular with a view to promoting sustainable development . Bearing this principle in mind , the Eurosystem promotes good environmental management based on the ISO 14000 series of standards . According to Article 9 of the Treaty , in defining and implementing its policies and activities , the Union shall take into account requirements , inter alia , linked to the protection of human health . Bearing this principle in mind , the avoidance and minimisation of any risks to the health and safety of the general public and of the workers involved in the production of euro banknotes or of euro banknote raw materials is of paramount importance to the Eurosystem .
L407	The Eurosystem supports good health and safety management in line with the policies of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work ( 1 ) and the OHSAS 18000 series of standards .

As I have just pointed out , Article 2 expressly provides that it applies to ' specified foodstuffs' . However , as we have also just seen , this term implicitly , but necessarily , covers foodstuffs for infants and young children ( assuming , it must be remembered , that such foodstuffs are produced from the GMOs referred to by Decisions 96/281 and 97/98 ) . To exclude such foodstuffs from the scope of Article 2(2)(b ) would therefore be more of a legislative exercise that an exercise of pure interpretation .

The European Union 's policy in the Middle East is the litmus test of its common foreign and security policy .

L433	Done at Brussels , 22 October 2004 . Annexes I and II to the Directive contain the types of habitats and species whose conservation requires the designation of special areas of conservation . Some of them are defined as " priority " habitats or species ( in danger of disappearing ) . Special areas of conservation are designated in three stages . Following the criteria set out in the annexes , each Member State must draw up a list of sites hosting natural habitats and wild fauna and flora . On the basis of the national lists and by agreement with the Member States , the Commission will then adopt a list of sites of Community importance for each of the nine EU biogeographical regions ( the Alpine region , the Atlantic region , the Black Sea region , the Boreal region , the Continental region , the Macronesian region , the Mediterranean region , the Pannonian region and the Steppic region ) . Where the Commission considers that a site which hosts a priority natural habitat type or a priority species has been omitted from a national list , the Directive provides for a bilateral consultation procedure to be initiated between that Member State and the Commission . If the result of the consultation is unsatisfactory , the Commission must forward a proposal to the Council relating to the selection of the site as a site of Community importance .
L434	Services It is foreseen that co - funding of operational services should be ensured by the GMES programme . The challenge is to consolidate the outcome of the massive investment already made within the EU research framework programme and at national and intergovernmental levels . The various user communities are expecting the EU to ensure the sustainability of GMES services and to implement accompanying measures in support of innovation and market uptake in the downstream sector . The costs for the service component will be assessed on the basis of the scope identified by the expert groups of user communities , previous studies and on the basis of the already available pre - operational services[10 ] . On the basis of precise costs estimates , the Commission will make a legislative proposal for defining the EU contribution for the operational phase of GMES for 2011 - 2013 . Subject to a budgetary and financial evaluation and the availability of the necessary funds and organisational structures , the EU contribution beyond 2014 should sustain the operations of GMES .

Also , as the applicant confirmed during the administrative procedure , without being contradicted on the point by the intervener , the words ' fonds' and ' zins' joined to the prefix ' uni' in the earlier marks UNIFONDS and UNIZINS signify , respectively , investment ' funds' and ' interest' .

Secondly , English is widely used and understood in the milieu in question , that is to say , in the financial services sector . Furthermore , as regards the terms ' wealth' and ' management' , as the Board of Appeal rightly emphasised in paragraph 40 of the contested decision of 25 September 2006 , those terms are commonly used in the financial sector , even in Germany , in connection with financial services such as investment consultancy services and accounting services .

Summary and recommendations The EESC agrees that the 2005 Council Decision ( 1 ) on new psychoactive substances ( NPS ) needs updating . It agrees with the need for better coordinated action between the EU agencies involved , a tighter timetable for data collection , and the possibility of a more nuanced internal classification into substances presenting low , moderate or severe risks . Any actions to restrict supply should follow these classifications in a timely and proportionate manner .
L500	The EESC also notes that supporting data for the underpinning impact assessment were often not available , that usage of NPS varies across the EU , and that public attitudes and political responses differ sharply .

Even if the economy grows at 2.5 % in 2012 , as most forecasts anticipate , the jobs deficit will remain - and will not be closed until 2024 . America 's jobs deficit is primarily the result of inadequate aggregate demand . Consumption , which accounts for about 70 % of total spending , is constrained by high unemployment , weak wage gains , and a steep decline in home values and consumer wealth . Neither of these trends is healthy or sustainable . With an unemployment rate of 8.5 % , a labor - force participation rate of only 64 % , and stagnant real wages , labor income has fallen to an historic low of 44 % of national income . And labor income is the most important component of household earnings , the major driver of consumption spending . Even before the Great Recession , American workers and households were in trouble . The rate of job growth between 2000 and 2007 slowed to only half its level in the three preceding decades .

Moreover , job opportunities continued to polarize , with employment growing in high - wage professional , technical , and managerial occupations , as well as in low - wage food - service , personal - care , and protective - service occupations . Absorption Following oral administration of GIOTRIF , Cmax of afatinib were observed approximately 2 to 5 hours post dose .

Systemic exposure to afatinib is decreased by 50 % ( Cmax ) and 39 % ( AUC0-∞ ) , when administered with a high - fat meal compared to administration in the fasted state . Based on population pharmacokinetic data derived from clinical trials in various tumour types , an average decrease of 26 % in AUCτ,ss was observed when food was consumed within 3 hours before or 1 hour after taking GIOTRIF . Therefore , food should not be consumed for at least 3 hours before and at least 1 hour after taking GIOTRIF ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . She does n't get it . Christ ! Christ !

That is not the case with regard to a document issued by the Commission in connection with assistance provided under the Structural Funds relating to the date of eligibility of new expenditure when programming documents are amended , which uses the words ' it is proposed to introduce the following rules' , since a proposal is a clear and specific indication that the document is not intended to have legal effects . Moreover , before that document was distributed to the Member States , the Commission gave an express warning that such a document was internal , was not always the final version , and merely reflected the Commission 's opinion .

There were faceless dummies , a score of them , climbing up and climbing down and standing on the landings and walking into the gardens ... On the other hand , the Common Position does not address some issues raised in the Parliament 's amendments , leaving them for further consideration and discussion . These include the mandatory nature of the targets , a possible longer target period , possible higher targets , and the need for a specific target for the public sector . Although many of these issues will be considered at a later date , the Commission must underscore the fact that it can not accept the Common Position 's modification of the 1 % mandatory overall savings target to an indicative target[1 ] .
L572	Finally , there is a recital ( 8a ) in the Common Position that re - iterates the fact that indicative targets are not legally binding . This is also unacceptable by the Commission because it negates and reduces even further the importance of complying with and respecting the targets . The Common Position thus postpones until later the discussion on a number of the amendments from the European Parliament . Some of these could probably have been accepted in part or in principle by the Member States and included in the Common Position , had time allowed for them to be discussed at length . The need to consolidate and include in the Common Position the compromises reached in all the other areas of the proposal has instead been given priority . Yes . And ... sexy .

However , in cases which are not amenable to out - of - court settlement ( e.g. litigation in family matters ) failure by the plaintiff to appear in court can lead to the case being dropped while an absent opposing party can either be fined or be brought to court . If the complainant fails to appear at proceedings before the court of appeal the appeal can lapse . If the opposing party fails to appear a fine can be imposed . Time limit for appeal If a party appeals too late the appeal will be dismissed . If the time limit is not laid down by law the party must before the time limit has expired , apply to the court for a delay and ask for the period to be extended . If the time limit has expired and the court has subsequently taken action , e.g. ruled on the case , there are a number of ordinary and extraordinary measures a party can take . « Procedural time limits - General information | Sweden - General information » Last update : 13 - 06 - 2007

The final concentration of the vehicle should not affect cell viability . Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes , human lymphocytes or established cell lines ( e.g. human diploid fibroblasts ) may be used in the assay . Test conditions Number of cultures At least two cell cultures for autoradiography and six cultures ( or less if scientifically justified ) for LSC UDS determinations are necessary for each experimental point . Use of negative and positive controls Concurrent positive and negative ( untreated and/or vehicle ) controls with and without metabolic activation should be included in each experiment . Examples of positive controls for the rat hepatocyte assay include 7,12- dimethylbenzathracene ( 7,12- DMBA ) or 2-acetylaminofluorene ( 2-AAF ) . In the case of established cell lines 4-nitroquinoline - N - oxide ( 4-NQO ) is an example of a positive control for both the autoradiographic and LSC assays performed without metabolic activation ;
L575	Metabolic activation A metabolic activation system is not used with primary hepatocyte cultures . The Union and the Member States , each within their respective powers , must take care that such services operate on the basis of principles and conditions which enable them to fulfil their missions . Certain SGEIs can be provided by public or private undertakings ( 1 ) without specific financial support from Member States' authorities . Other services can only be provided if the authority concerned offers financial compensation to the provider . The purpose of this Communication is to clarify the key concepts underlying the application of the State aid rules to public service compensation ( 2 ) . It will therefore focus on those State aid requirements that are most relevant for public service compensation . In parallel with this Communication , the Commission envisages adopting an SGEI - specific de minimis Regulation clarifying that certain compensation measures do not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 of the Treaty ( 3 ) , and is issuing a Decision ( 4 ) , which declares certain types of SGEI compensation constituting State aid to be compatible with the Treaty pursuant to Article 106(2 ) of the Treaty and exempts them from the notification obligation under Article 108(3 ) of the Treaty , and a Framework ( 5 ) , which sets out the conditions under which State aid for SGEIs not covered by the Decision can be declared compatible under Article 106(2 ) of the Treaty .
L576	In addition to the issues addressed in this Communication , the Decision 2012/21/EU and the Communication from the Commission on EU Framework for State aid in the form of public service compensation ( 2011 ) , the Commission will answer individual questions that arise in the context of the application of the State aid rules to SGEIs . It will do so inter alia through its Interactive Information Service on Services of General Interest , which is accessible on the Commission 's website ( 10 ) . " Come , " Melein urged them .

The dark inside held no threat ; it was quieter there , and the clouds of sand and dust did not pursue them far inside . " We " ? Oh , yes . There are times when I experience a total loss of faith .

But Hearst was not the United States and he had no guns and no ships and no authority . What he did have was a loud voice and no respect for tyrants . Somehow those masochistic revisionists have turned the War of 1898 into a case of imperialistic aggression by the United States . But revisionism always starts with the assumption that the United States is the villain . In April 1898 , to us benighted country people certain simple facts were true . Spain had declared war on us . The President had asked for volunteers . The next day , Monday 25 April , came the President 's call asking the state militias to furnish one hundred and twenty- five thousand volunteers to augment our almost - nonexistent army .

L583	Self - evaluation was often restricted to one - off activities without subsequent corrective action . The study has recommended a mix of external evaluation and assisted self - evaluation at LAG level with strong support from regional and national networks . There is a strong need for tool development : some com- pendia or exemplary information on self - evaluation have been prepared by national network units ( NNU ) , as is the case in Finland and Austria . The Finnish NNU has published two comprehensive documents on self - evaluation which are available in English . The Austrian NNU has started an initiative to establish LAG self - evaluation within an overall framework of Leader quality management .

The refund must be fixed every two weeks . It may be altered in the intervening period . The first subparagraph of Article 27(5 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination , where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary .

Exorcising Musharraf\u0027s Ghost CAMBRIDGE - Following its recent free elections , Pakistan is rebounding politically . But the euphoria that came with the end of the Musharraf era is wearing off , as the new government faces stark choices . Pakistan 's new prime minister , Yousaf Gilani , is a seasoned politician and , more importantly , has Sufi family roots , which is a good omen because of the Sufi tradition of tolerance . Gilani unequivocally declared in his inaugural address that fighting terrorism is a top priority , and his first decision was to release from house arrest judges deposed by Musharraf . But the honeymoon period is coming to an end . Already , in Gilani 's hometown of Multan , rioters attacked government offices and banks to protest electricity disruptions . A couple of well - known opposition politicians , a chief minister and a federal cabinet minister of the previous pro - Musharraf government , were publicly thrashed , raising doubts about government control over law and order in the country . So far , Musharraf has accepted his diminishing stature quietly - though he has few other options .
L615	The deeper question raised by this proposal is whether Musharraf meant to convey a message to the US that Pakistan 's priorities were shifting . Take them right upstairs .

Notwithstanding paragraph 5(c ) of Annex IV to Regulation ( EC ) No 479/2008 , when kept at a temperature of 20 ° C in closed containers of a capacity of less than 25 cl . , quality sparkling wines with a protected designation of origin must have an excess pressure of not less than 3 bar . Related actions ( Article 28 ) The provision on related actions represents an important aspect of the coordination of jurisdiction in the States bound by the Convention . When several non - identical actions are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together , in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments that would not be mutually recognised by the States concerned , the Convention provides for coordination of the proceedings of the courts of the different States before which such actions are pending .
L633	Article 28 does not make the relation between the actions a general criterion of jurisdiction , as is done in certain national legal systems , and in particular does not confer jurisdiction on a court hearing an action that has come before it according to the rules of the Convention to rule on another action that is related to the first ( 152 ) ; instead , it establishes procedures intended to facilitate the handling of related cases in a single set of proceedings or in coordinated proceedings . Provided that the tests of Article 28(3 ) are satisfied , therefore , a court seised subsequently is entitled - but not obliged - to stay the proceedings and await the decision of the court first seised before deciding the case before it . The new wording of Article 28(1 ) no longer requires , as the previous version did , that the related actions be pending at first instance . The reason given for that requirement , namely that ' otherwise , the object of the proceedings would be different and one of the parties might be deprived of a step in the hierarchy of the courts' ( 153 ) , does not appear convincing . The stay of the proceedings by the court subsequently seised has no effect whatever on the proceedings in that court , which it is free to resume once the proceedings on the related action pending before the foreign court have been concluded .
L634	In any case , it is not possible for the court seised subsequently to decline jurisdiction unless one of the parties so requests , unless the court first seised has jurisdiction to hear the case , and unless that court 's laws allow for consolidation of the actions .

Nine years after the date of entry into force of this Directive . See how flexible the hind legs are ? The application to introduce a new plea in law a ) 22 That new decision provides additional evidence in support of the argument put forward in the appeal that an employment relationship of employer and employee was established between the SNE and the Commission , and that the allowances received by the SNE in that context are in the nature of pay . In addition , the 2008 SNE decision no longer contains a provision for the reduction in the daily allowance where , at the time of the request for secondment , the place of secondment is the same as the principal residence of the SNE 's spouse or of any or his or her dependent children . In addition , if the appellant took the view that the adoption of the 2008 SNE decision was relevant for the purposes of assessing her case before the General Court , she ought to have made an application to the General Court for revision , pursuant to Article 44 of the Statute of the Court of Justice and Articles 125 and 126 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court .
L638	24 In the alternative , the Commission contends that Article 42 of the Rules of Procedure should be interpreted as containing an implied condition that the matter relied on must be relevant . In addition , the appellant 's argument has no factual basis , since the 2008 SNE decision preserves entirely the distinction between SNEs , on the one hand , and officials and servants of the Commission , on the other . b ) Findings of the Court 25 The first subparagraph of Article 42(2 ) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court , which applies to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 118 of those rules , provides that no new plea in law may be introduced in the course of proceedings unless it is based on matters of law or of fact which come to light in the course of the procedure .

Within the recommended noise modelling methodology such time histories are not defined ; event exposure levels are calculated by summing segment values , partial event levels each of which defines the contribution from a single , finite segment of the flight path .

L644	It is inherent in the system of prior review of State aid measures that notifications must of necessity include estimates concerning the total amounts of the aid planned . 67 In the light of all the foregoing and in the absence of transitional provisions extending the temporal scope of Regulation No 1177/2002 , the second plea must be dismissed in its entirety . The third plea : infringement of Articles 87 EC , 88 EC and 253 EC Arguments of the parties 68 The Italian Republic claims that , even if it were to be supposed that the measure notified should be regarded as new aid , since it falls outside the scope of Regulation No 1177/2002 , the Commission infringed Article 87(2 ) and ( 3 ) EC , and Article 88(3 ) EC in so far as it failed to examine effectively in the contested decision whether the measure notified could be considered compatible with the common market by virtue of one of the exceptions provided for in Article 87(2 ) and ( 3 ) EC and , in particular , of those set out in Article 87(3)(b ) and ( c ) EC .
L645	71 In any event , the Italian Republic adds that , during the administrative procedure , it had attempted to draw the Commission 's attention to the fact that the measure notified was necessary in order to achieve competitive equality between all the operators likely to benefit from the aid . The Italian Republic states also that the absence of aid could have led to the closure of shipyards . Nevertheless , in the contested decision , the Commission did not provide any suitable answers to those suggestions . 72 Furthermore , the Italian Republic requests the Court to assess the measure notified itself and to declare it compatible with the common market . 73 Moreover , the Italian Republic claims , for the same reasons as those set out in paragraphs 68 to 71 above , that the grounds set out in recital 26 of the contested decision are insufficient , which , in its opinion , amounts to an infringement of Article 253 EC . In that regard , the Italian Republic refers to the case - law according to which , in order to comply with its obligation to state reasons , the Commission must mention specific circumstances , not general circumstances .
L646	74 Lastly , the Italian Republic claims that the contested decision is also vitiated by a failure to state reasons , in so far as the Commission confined itself to examining the measure notified , without taking account in its analysis of the 2004 scheme , to which the measure notified referred .

L653	There are other measures that might help . For example , governments should help banks that lend to small- and medium - size enterprises , which are the main source of job creation - or establish new financial institutions that would do so - rather than supporting big banks that make their money from derivatives and abusive credit card practices . Financial markets have worked hard to create a system that enforces their views : with free and open capital markets , a small country can be flooded with funds one moment , only to be charged high interest rates - or cut off completely - soon thereafter .

In recent years , certain three party payment systems in which the system acts as the sole payment service provider for both the payer and the payee , have become respectable players in the market for processing payments . It is therefore no longer justified to allow these systems to benefit from an exemption with regard to providing access to other payment service providers , where other payment systems can not benefit from such exemption .

Serious side effects ( which have occurred in less than 1 in 2,200 injections ) may include blindness , endophthalmitis ( inflammation inside the eye ) , cataract , increased intraocular pressure , vitreous haemorrhage ( bleeding into the jelly - like fluid in the eye , causing temporary loss of vision ) and vitreous or retinal detachment . For the full list of all side effects reported with Eylea , see the package leaflet . Conclusions and recommendations The EESC agrees with the Commission 's view that , while essential , the broad regulatory programme of financial reforms undertaken prior to the present " Banking Union Package " will not be sufficient to tackle the crisis and stabilise Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) ( 1 ) , restore confidence in the euro and in the future of the EU , to improve governance , or to curtail the increasing fragmentation of EU banking markets .
L658	The validity of a Community act in the light of the principle of proportionality can not depend on retrospective assessment of its efficacy . Where the Community legislature is obliged to assess the future effects of rules to be adopted and those effects can not be accurately foreseen , its assessment is open to criticism only if it appears manifestly incorrect in the light of the information available to it at the time of the adoption of the rules in question . Thus , when what is at issue is the adoption of rules designed to protect public health , it must be accepted that , where there is uncertainty as to the existence or extent of risks to human health , the institutions , applying the principle of precaution and preventive action , may take protective measures without having to wait until the reality and seriousness of those risks become fully apparent . On the other hand , when new elements change the perception of a risk or show that that risk can be contained by less restrictive measures than the existing measures , it is for the institutions and in particular the Commission , which has the power of legislative initiative , to bring about an amendment to the rules in the light of the new information .

NGOs also active in the field of animal protection may participate in this Programme , provided that such activities serve to achieve environmental protection objectives ( within the principles of Article 174 of the EC Treaty ) . Contributions would be towards the costs that European environmental NGOs have to bear in carrying out the activities provided for in their 2006 annual work programme . Applicant organisations should be operating at a European level , either singly or in the form of several coordinated associations , with a structure ( membership base ) and activities covering at least three European countries . Coverage of two European countries is acceptable , provided that the primary objective of the activities is to support the development and implementation of Community environmental policy .

Furthermore , it should be noted , in this respect , that Article 6 of the Charter lays down the right of any person not only to liberty , but also to security . 43 In this respect , it is apparent from recital 7 in the preamble to Directive 2006/24 that , because of the significant growth in the possibilities afforded by electronic communications , the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 19 December 2002 concluded that data relating to the use of electronic communications are particularly important and therefore a valuable tool in the prevention of offences and the fight against crime , in particular organised crime . 44 It must therefore be held that the retention of data for the purpose of allowing the competent national authorities to have possible access to those data , as required by Directive 2006/24 , genuinely satisfies an objective of general interest .

Randy was expecting one of these gracile , translucent Nipponese seniors , but Goto Dengo is a blocky fellow with a white buzz - cut , somewhat hunched and collapsed with age , which only goes to make him seem more compact and solid . At first blush he seems more like a retired village blacksmith , or perhaps a master sergeant in a daimyo 's army , than a business executive , and yet within five or ten seconds this impression is swallowed up by a good suit , good manners , and Randy 's knowledge of who he really is . He 's the only guy in the place who is n't grinning from ear to ear : apparently when you reach a certain age you are allowed to get away with staring tunnels through other people 's skulls . In the manner of many old people , he looks vaguely startled that they have actually shown up . Still , he levers himself up on a big , gnarled cane and shakes their hands firmly . His son Furudenendu proffers a hand to help him to his feet and he shrugs it off with glare of mock outrage - this transaction looks pretty well - practiced .

Eligibility of VAT costs A further simplification step has been the alignment of the provisions on reimbursement of VAT costs in the different sectoral programmes with the relevant provision in the Financial Regulation . Such an alignment will ensure coherence in the treatment of VAT costs borne by the beneficiaries under the different programmes , in line with the Financial Regulation , and will ensure legal clarity . Moreover , only a very limited number of exceptions to this standard rule have been introduced - in the CPR , in home affairs funds and in the CEF .

COMPATIBILITY OF THE AID As a preliminary remark , the Authority notes that whilst Landsbankinn is a new legal entity that was established in 2008 , it is - as regards domestic operations - evidently the economic successor of Landsbanki , in the sense that there is an economic continuity between those two entities . In fact , the Icelandic authorities have explained that the similarity of names of old and new bank are intended to allow Landsbankinn to capitalise on the goodwill still associated with the name ' Landsbanki' in Iceland . As stated in the opening decision , the Authority would probably have temporarily approved the measures as compatible rescue aid had they been notified before their implementation , before then taking a final view on them on the basis of a restructuring plan . However , in the absence of a timely notification , the Authority initiated the formal investigation procedure and requested the submission of a restructuring plan . No one can .

" Enhancing Latin America 's stability and prosperity Over the last few years , Brazil has strengthened its relations with its neighbours , particularly Argentina , with whom Brazil has established a ' strategic relationship' . On the political front , Brazil has become a pillar of South American stability . It has been able to address challenges faced by many countries in the region ( such as social cohesion ) within the framework of its political and institutional system . Brazil has been at the forefront of efforts to deepen South American integration both through Mercosur and with the founding of the South American Community of Nations in December 2004 , leading to the establishment of UNASUR at the regional Summit in April 2007 . In recent years Brazil 's relations with its neighbours have been marked by moderation , as shown by the way in which it has handled areas where there are divergences of views with Venezuela and Bolivia .
L691	Brazil 's participation in any big regional energy scheme is an essential condition for its contribution to the regional energy infrastructures . The development of bi - oceanic corridors along Pan - American axes means that Brazil is now better integrated into the Latin American transport network . - The EU will work in continued engagement with Brazil in implementing the recommendations of the EU - LAC Conference on Social Cohesion of March 2006 and in moving this agenda forward . Preparations for the EU - LAC Forum on Social cohesion will provide a good opportunity for dialogue .

" With the goal of making the European energy network a reality , the Priority Interconnection Plan highlights the importance of financial and political support for implementing the infrastructures which have been identified as essential and of nominating European coordinators for monitoring the most problematic priority projects . An energy public service The EU is determined to persevere with its fight against energy poverty by developing an Energy Customers ' Charter . ENSURE A SECURE ENERGY SUPPLY Minimising the EU 's vulnerability concerning imports , shortfalls in supply , possible energy crises and uncertainty with respect to future supply is a clear priority .
L693	This uncertainty is all the more problematic for Member States dependent on one single gas supplier . The new energy policy emphasises the importance of measures which ensure solidarity between Member States and of the diversification of supply sources and transportation routes . Determined to fight against climate change , the EU is committed to reducing its own emissions by at least 20 % by 2020 . It also calls for the conclusion of an international agreement which will oblige developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 30 % by 2020 . In the framework of this agreement , the EU would set itself a new objective of reducing its own emissions by 30 % compared with 1990 levels . Of course , reducing greenhouse gas emissions involves using less energy and using more clean energy . Energy efficiency Reducing its energy consumption by 20 % by 2020 is the objective the EU has set itself in its Action Plan for Energy Efficiency ( 2007 - 2012 ) . Concrete effort needs to be made to achieve this objective , in particular with respect to energy saving in the transport sector , the development of minimum efficiency requirements for energy - using appliances , awareness - raising amongst consumers about sensible and economic energy use , improving the efficiency of the production , transport and distribution of heating and electricity and also developing energy technologies and improving the energy performance of buildings .

The fifth and final specific objective was to establish and consolidate the Agency in its final operational form . In addition , a number of actions from the 2008 Work Programme were carried over to 2009 : the treatment of old payment requests received by DG MOVE before the Agency 's autonomy ; the creation of the Agency 's website and the improvement of the visibility of the TEN - T programme ; the creation of the TEN - T EA Staff Committee and the finalisation of the Implementing Rules for personnel management ; the development of the Geographical Information System , statistical tools and innovative financing methods .

That list includes propachlor . For propachlor the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations ( EC ) No 451/2000 and ( EC ) No 1490/2002 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier . Moreover , those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) in accordance with Article 8(1 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 451/2000 . For propachlor the rapporteur Member State was the Netherlands and all relevant information was submitted on 23 May 2007 .

The annual budget devoted by Member States fluctuates from € 40.000 to € 1.000.000 based on public , private or mixed funding , excluding hidden contributions in staff and services . The total annual funding in place in all Member States can be estimated at about € 8 million spent in research projects . This funding is devoted to specific national projects without any coordination of the different actions carried out in the EU .
L710	During the survey carried out by FCEC , 15 Member States indicated that minor uses are considered to be so important that structural money and manpower are spent to address the issue . But no one considers that the resources available are sufficient to solve the problem at national level . Additional measures will focus on improving the business environment , removing regulatory and non - regulatory barriers to investment and further reinforcing the Single Market . The Commission will table several proposals designed to implement this approach rapidly and will look further at the applicable state aid rules . With all Partnership Agreements for the European Structural and Investment Funds 2014- 2020 now approved , the remaining operational programmes being finalised , investment should start delivering on the Europe 20207 goals of smart , sustainable and inclusive growth in 2015 . Maximising the impact of the EU budget for jobs , growth and investment with a renewed awareness of the need to improve the way public money is spent will feed into reflections on the mid - term review of the Multi - annual Financial Framework ( MFF ) and preparations for the post-2020 MFF package later in the Commission 's mandate . The Commission will review the EU 's trade and investment policy strategy with a particular focus on its contribution to jobs and growth .
L711	The consolidation of EU trade and investment links to new centres of growth in the world is not only vital for jobs , growth and enhanced productivity in the EU , but has important impacts on our neighbourhood and development policy as well as on EU participation in international financial institutions . Member States are facing the difficult challenge of getting more people into work , and ensuring that workers have the skills they need to progress and adapt to the jobs of the future . The Commission will present a package of measures to support these efforts to help boost integration in the labour market and promote skills . Well - drafted EU legislation and its effective implementation can have a major impact on jobs , growth and innovation . Eco - industries and eco - innovation currently supply a third of the global market for green technologies , worth a trillion Euros and expected to double by 2020 . The revised proposal for the circular economy will reinforce this trend thus contributing to green growth . Member States may make provision for national regulatory authorities to decline to resolve a dispute through a binding decision where other mechanisms , including mediation , exist and would better contribute to resolution of the dispute in a timely manner in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 .

Following its review , the Commission imposed conditions on four projects , relating to the reduction of water losses . However , in one case the Commission did not quantify the objectives concerned ; in another case , the deadlines for meeting them were set for after the completion date of the project , by which time the balance of the grant would have been paid .

If the applicant fails to put the application in order or to produce the required documents , the Civil Service Tribunal will decide whether the non - compliance with those conditions renders the application formally inadmissible . However , in a situation where the Registrar has not asked the applicant to put his application in order or to produce the required documents , there is clearly no provision of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of First Instance which prevents the Civil Service Tribunal from taking measures of organisation of procedure in order to secure production of the document in question .

L719	54 According to the first indent of Article 20 of Directive 92/83 , the concept of ' ethyl alcohol' refers inter alia to ' all products with an actual alcoholic strength by volume exceeding 1.2 % which fall within CN codes 2207 and 2208' . CN code 2207 refers , in particular , to undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of 80 % or higher and also ethyl alcohol , denatured , of any strength . 55 A product such as that at issue in the main proceedings , which is ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of over 80 % , therefore comes within CN code 2207 . 56 The fact that the term ' bioethanol' is not found in the wording of that CN heading is irrelevant in that regard . In the interests of legal certainty and ease of verification , the decisive criterion for the classification of goods for customs purposes is in general to be sought in their objective characteristics and properties as defined in the wording of the relevant heading of the CN and in the section or chapter notes ( see , inter alia , Case C - 142/06 Olicom [ 2007 ] ECR I - 6675 , paragraph 16 and case - law cited ) .
L720	The Commission considers that it has made significant progress in recent years as regards reporting on policy achievements and that notably the Annual Activity Reports of its Directorates - General contain a wealth of useful information on policy objectives , the results attained and their impact on society . The indicators presented generally provide useful information on progress towards attaining the Commission 's overall policy objectives as well as for monitoring performance . The Court recognises the Commission 's commitment to strengthen the performance culture within the Commission and to develop a reliable and robust performance management and reporting system . Towards that end , the Commission will present , in 2014 , a new framework for performance reporting for the next MFF . Furthermore , the Commission has taken initiatives to strengthen and streamline its services reporting on performance in the remainder of the current programming period ( see paragraphs 10.20 to 10.24 ) . However , it doubts that the report can fulfil any intended use in the discharge procedure to start to provide reliable evidence on what EU policies have achieved before late in the MFF . As in previous years , in its performance audit work published in its 2012 special reports , the Court has identified weaknesses affecting the entirety of a typical management lifecycle . It is important to address these issues if the desired results and impacts are to be obtained from the next generation of spending programmes ( see paragraphs 10.25 to 10.44 ) .

L732	It is not a requirement of the Sixth Directive and Directive 2006/112 that , for a supply of goods or services to be effected for consideration , the consideration for the supply must be obtained directly from the person to whom the goods or services are supplied . A completely new administrative structure substitutes the formerly responsible Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate 's ( NVE ) competence with that of the newly founded administrative body Enova . Enova is bound by an Agreement with the Ministry to administer the Energy Fund to achieve Parliament 's newly defined energy objective and to manage the Fund according to the newly adopted legislation . It further is called upon to promote - through the administration of the funds - competition in the market . Finally , it is of importance that a new financing mechanism has been set up . Instead of budgetary allocations , the support measures are ( increasingly ) financed via the means of a levy on the distribution tariff , which is used for financing the Energy Fund . While Norway pointed out that the levy as such has been introduced prior to the entry into force of the EEA Agreement , this does not alter the Authority 's finding that the introduction of the new financing mechanism resulted in a substantial change . Before 2002 , the levy was managed by the grid companies to mainly finance their own information activities on energy efficiency .
L733	Now the levy is set up and controlled by the Norwegian State , which earmarks it for financing the Energy Fund . In light of the above , the Authority concludes that the alterations to the funding system are of a substantial nature . The described changes alter the aid scheme as such , without being a severable part from the existing schemes ( 58 ) . The new financing and administrative mechanism as well as Enova 's obligation to achieve newly defined energy objectives concern the very structure of the support programme and apply to all measures supported under the Energy Fund . The alterations were undertaken with a view to make better use of public resources and achieve more sustainable energy efficiency results , which made it necessary to introduce new structures and new objectives . These new structures and objectives determine each support decision and can not be considered as severable from the formerly existing aid measures .

In theory , the host country could hire its own international experts to assist it in negotiations . But poor countries typically lack the funds needed to pay such a team 's fees . Nor do the World Bank and regional development banks have the in - house expertise - or , as a rule , the funds - to provide technical assistance . But what if MNEs provided the funds ?
L769	But , even if a company embraces this approach , problems abound . How can it be implemented without looking like bribery ( in case the company gives the funds directly to the government ) ? And how can companies prevent some of the funds from being misused ( say , if the government hires a third - rate team ) ? Here is a proposal : an Investment Contract Aid Facility ( ICAF ) under the umbrella of a well - respected organization . The ICAF would function like an escrow account into which the firm pays the funds required for the host country to hire a negotiating team . The escrow account manager then invites the country to select a team , suggesting what skills are required and perhaps even providing a roster of experts . The country would be free to choose its own team , but the escrow account manager , aided by an international advisory board of expert volunteers , would need to agree that it is , in fact , world - class . One could even include a capacity - building element by adding to the team one or two local negotiators .

L775	Those emission limit values shall however not exceed the emission limit values set out in Annexes V to VIII , where applicable . The Commission may establish criteria for the granting of the derogation referred to in this paragraph . Those measures , designed to amend non - essential elements of this Directive , by supplementing it , shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 69(2 ) . Reason The Committee of the Regions strongly disagrees with the Commission 's proposal to establish criteria for the granting of derogation based on local conditions in accordance with the comitology procedure ( Article 16(3 ) ) . Criteria for granting derogations should have been defined in the Directive itself ( and thus decided by a co - decision procedure ) and should not be defined in the future at the EU level via the comitology procedure in which the CoR and other representatives of local and regional authorities are not consulted . Due to a large variety in local and regional conditions it is very difficult if not impossible to establish uniform criteria on the EU level . The derogation procedure comprises sufficient guarantees to prevent misuse , as permit issuing authorities can only derogate on the basis of an impact assessment ( Article 16(3 ) ) and are obliged to make the justification available to the public ( Article 26(3f ) ) .
L776	Hello ? ( Distant conversation ) : The new Sam is in reworking order . But we only have two working harvesters now . Most of the expenditure is directed towards three priority policy objectives : Objective 2 : supporting the economic and social conversion of areas facing structural difficulties ; These are programmes of Community interest carried out in and by the Member States at the initiative of the Commission to supplement actions implemented under the main programmes . Each programme or project must be approved by the Commission and is accompanied by an indicative financial plan which specifies the amount of Community aid and the Member State 's contribution . For the 1994 to 1999 period the Commission approved 1 104 Structural Funds programmes and 920 Cohesion Fund projects . For the 2000 to 2006 period there are 470 Structural Funds programmes and 450 Cohesion Fund projects ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 ) .
L777	For the 1994 to 1999 and previous programme periods , contributions for structural measures were paid in the form of advances and final payments , the latter constituting the ' closure' of the programmes or projects . Community financing in the 2000 to 2006 programme period takes the form of a single initial advance payment of 7 % of the total contribution to the programme or project , followed by the periodic reimbursement of expenditure declared by the Member States and final payments . These reimbursements are called ' interim payments' . Structural measures are subject to the principle of ' shared management' . Where the programme is terminated because partner countries do not sign financing agreements within the required deadlines , budgetary allocations already committed to cross - border cooperation under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument under heading 1B of the Financial Perspective ( Interinstitutional Agreement 2006/C 139/01 ) shall remain available for their normal lifetime but may be used only for activities which take place exclusively in the Member States concerned .

L778	While Article 10(1bis ) of Law No 109/94 pursues a legitimate aim of ensuring equal treatment , the Commission considers that it is disproportionate in nature as it does not allow tenderers who are linked by a relationship of control to prove that their offers were in fact drawn up autonomously and without the contents of their offers being known by the controlling company . The Commission therefore considers that the irrebutable presumption contained in Article 10(1bis ) of Law No 109/94 may not in fact promote competition . General principles Where appropriate , Member States shall impose conditions or restrictions on the authorisations they grant . Member States shall ensure that decisions taken to grant authorisations , take account of the agricultural , plant health or environmental ( including climatic ) conditions in the areas of envisaged use . Such considerations may result in specific conditions and restrictions on use , and , in authorisation being granted for some but not other areas within the Member State in question . Member States shall ensure that the authorised amounts , in terms of rates and number of applications , are the minimum necessary to achieve the desired effect even where higher amounts would not result in unacceptable risks to human or animal health or to the environment . The authorised amounts must be differentiated according to , and be appropriate to , the agricultural , plant health or environmental ( including climatic ) conditions in the various areas for which an authorisation is granted .

L787	| | United Kingdom Ruxolitinib has been evaluated in safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity studies and in a carcinogenicity study . Target organs associated with the pharmacological action of ruxolitinib in repeated dose studies include bone marrow , peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues . Infections generally associated with immunosuppression were noted in dogs . Adverse decreases in blood pressure along with increases in heart rate were noted in a dog telemetry study , and an adverse decrease in minute volume was noted in a respiratory study in rats . The margins ( based on unbound Cmax ) at the non - adverse level in the dog and rat studies were 15.7-fold and 10.4-fold greater , respectively , than the maximum human recommended dose of 25 mg twice daily . Ruxolitinib decreased foetal weight and increased post - implantation loss in animal studies . However , the exposure margins compared to the highest clinical dose were low and the results are therefore of limited relevance for humans . No effects were noted on fertility . In a pre- and post - natal development study , a slightly prolonged gestation period , reduced number of implantation sites , and reduced number of pups delivered were observed . In the pups , decreased mean initial body weights and short period of decreased mean body weight gain were observed .

In view of the apparent high number of exporting producers in the PRC and Turkey , importers and producers in the Community , the Commission indicated in the notice of initiation that sampling methods might be applied for the determination of dumping and injury , in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation .
L789	In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling would be necessary and , if so , to select a sample , all exporting producers in the PRC and in Turkey , Community importers and Community producers were asked to make themselves known to the Commission and to provide , as specified in the notice of initiation , basic information on their activities related to the product concerned . Given the limited number of responses to the sampling exercise , it was decided that sampling was not necessary for Chinese and Turkish exporting producers , or for Community producers and importers within the Community . Questionnaires were sent to all companies in the PRC , and Turkey who responded to the sampling exercise , to the sole Moldovan exporting producer , to all Community producers , users and importers who responded to the sampling exercise , and to all other parties known to be concerned . Replies were received from two groups of exporting producers in the PRC , one exporting producer in the RM , six exporting producers in Turkey , 20 Community producers , one importer and eight users in the Community . The Commission sought and verified all the information deemed necessary for a determination of dumping , resulting injury and Community interest and carried out verifications at the premises of the following companies : Get down on your knees now !

Now it is . I know you only have a few minutes but I can explain it pretty quickly . It is therefore for the national court to assess whether , having regard to the conduct of both the recipient of the funds and the administrative authority , the principles of legal certainty and the protection of legitimate expectations , as they are understood in Community law , may legitimately be relied on as a defence against claims for repayment . 58 Moreover , it can be seen from the observations made at the hearing by the Netherlands Government and the Commission that the sums unduly granted have been repayed to the Community . 59 It follows from the foregoing that the answer to the questions referred to the Court should be that the recovery of amounts lost as a result of an irregularity or negligence must be carried out on the basis of Article 23(1 ) of Regulation No 4253/88 and in accordance with the detailed rules laid down in national law , on condition that the application of that law does not hinder the application or the effectiveness of Community law and does not make it impossible in practice to recover the sums improperly granted .
L792	The national court may apply the Community law principles of legal certainty and the protection of legitimate expectations when assessing the conduct of both the recipient of the amounts lost and the administrative authority , on condition that full account is taken of the interests of the Community .

If , at the end of this period , two reference filters are used and one filter fails to meet the ± 5 μg criterion , the sample filter weighing may be considered valid provided that the sum of the absolute differences between specific and rolling averages from the two reference filters is no more than 10 μg . If fewer than half of the reference filters meet the ± 5 μg criterion , the sample filter shall be discarded and the emissions test repeated . All reference filters shall be discarded and replaced within 48 hours . In all other cases , reference filters shall be replaced at least every 30 days and in such a manner that no sample filter is weighed without comparison with a reference filter that has been in the weighing room for at least one day .

The Commission , for its part , argues that , if that provision is held to be applicable , the Court should rule that pharmaceutical and chemical products are patentable if they fulfil the general conditions for the grant of a patent and that those products enjoy the extended protection which is set out in Article 28 of the TRIPs Agreement .

First , in relation to proceedings concerning the grounds for refusal of registration , the examination is limited to the facts relating to the pleas in law and to the claims put forward by the parties . Second , Article 74(2 ) gives OHIM the discretionary power to disregard evidence which the parties did not submit ' in due time' . Since that phrase applies in relation to every procedure pending before OHIM , the expiry of time - limits for the production of evidence imposed by the department hearing the application at first instance therefore remains irrelevant to the issue of whether that evidence was produced ' in due time' before the Board of Appeal .

L828	On 14 July 2015 , the Council , on the basis of the Commission 's proposals , adopted a Recommendation on the broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States and the Union and , on 21 October 2010 , it adopted a decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States ( 2 ) . Together these form the ' integrated guidelines' which Member States were invited to take into account in their national economic and employment policies . On 8 July 2014 , the Council adopted a Recommendation ( 3 ) on Slovakia 's National Reform Programme for 2014 and delivered its opinion on Slovakia 's updated Stability Programme for 2014 . On 28 November 2014 , in line with Regulation ( EU ) No 473/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 4 ) , the Commission presented its opinion on Slovakia 's draft budgetary plan for 2015 . On the same day , on the basis of Regulation ( EU ) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 5 ) , the Commission adopted the Alert Mechanism Report , in which Slovakia was not identified as one of the Member States for which an in - depth review would be carried out . On 18 December 2014 , the European Council endorsed the priorities for fostering investment , intensifying structural reforms and pursuing responsible growth - friendly fiscal consolidation .
L829	In its 2015 Stability Programme , the Government plans to gradually improve the headline deficit to 2,5 % of GDP in 2015 and further to 0,5 % of GDP in 2018 . For employment , the focus is on combating youth unemployment , and for competitiveness , on investing further in research and technical education , as well as on developing models for all - day schools . The initiatives presented under the Pact are in line with the national reform programme and are in compliance with the Federal Budgetary Framework Law and the stability programme . However , while the measures address some of the main socio - economic issues facing the country , there are outstanding challenges that could usefully have been covered in the commitments , including in the areas of fiscal policy , education , competition and innovation . The Commission has assessed the stability programme and national reform programme , and the Euro Plus Pact commitments for Austria . It has taken into account not only their relevance for sustainable fiscal and socio - economic policy in Austria , but also their observance of EU rules and guidance , given the need to reinforce the overall economic governance of the EU by providing EU - level input into future national decisions .

Specify measures as needed to ensure adequate progress towards the medium - term objective in line with the Stability and Growth Pact ( SGP ) after correction of the excessive deficit . Take steps to further strengthen the national budgetary framework by aligning legislative , administrative , revenue - raising and spending responsibilities across the different levels of government , in particular in the area of health care . In consultation with the social partners and according to national practices , take steps to further limit access to the current early retirement scheme for people with long insurance periods and take steps to reduce the transition period for harmonisation of the statutory retirement age between men and women to ensure the sustainability and adequacy of the pension system .

While the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations is one of the fundamental principles of the Community , traders are not justified in having a legitimate expectation that an existing situation which is capable of being altered by the Community institutions in the exercise of their discretionary power will be maintained , particularly in an area such as that of the common organisation of the markets , the objective of which involves constant adjustment to reflect changes in economic circumstances . Accordingly , the businesses affected by the importation of bananas into the Community could not have any reasonable expectation that the applicable rules would be maintained since those rules have not only been amended many times , in particular on account of international commitments given by the Community within the framework of the World Trade Organisation , but require constant adjustment to reflect changes in the economic situation , leaving scope for broad discretion on the part of the Community institutions .

Aid to encourage the production of quality agricultural products : Aid is granted at a rate of up to 70 % of costs incurred ; this is to be in the form of subsidised services and must not involve direct payments of money to producers . 36 Furthermore , neither Article 34(2 ) EU nor any other provision of Title VI of the EU Treaty draws a distinction as to the type of measures which may be adopted on the basis of the subject - matter to which the joint action in the field of criminal cooperation relates . 37 Article 34(2 ) EU also does not establish any order of priority between the different instruments listed in that provision , with the result that it can not be ruled out that the Council may have a choice between several instruments in order to regulate the same subject - matter , subject to the limits imposed by the nature of the instrument selected . In order to determine the actual production volume , the institutions relied on information according to which the applicant was operating at 80 % of full nameplate capacity .
L841	The fact that , in the same recital , the Council also referred to the substantial difference between total nameplate capacity in the US and US demand in no way shows that it based its spare production capacity calculation on a comparison between those two elements . 50 As to the applicant 's argument that the US industry had been operating at full capacity , this was contradicted by the evidence submitted during the procedure regarding the use of its own production capacity ( that is to say , 80 % during the RIP ) . In addition , the arguments put forward by the applicant regarding the hurricanes which struck the States of Louisiana and Texas during the RIP were not made during the administrative procedure . The applicant can not therefore rely on those arguments in order to establish a manifest error of assessment on the part of the institutions . In any event , recital 26 of the contested regulation shows that the institutions did take account of the impact of the hurricanes which struck the States of Louisiana and Texas during the RIP . The applicant did not contest this point . 51 As regards the economic report mentioned by the applicant in its written submissions and referred to in recital 26 of the contested regulation , it confirmed the existence of potential unused production capacity in the US . In particular , that report showed that there is oversupply on the US market .

As the Court ruled in the case of Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging , ( 194 ) for the positive effect of annual leave to be fully deployed for the safety and health of the worker it must basically be taken in the year prescribed for that purpose , namely the current year .

The subject of the agreement between the Land of Hessen and Helaba was , therefore , the legal form of a silent partnership contribution of unlimited duration , which was recognised as such both by the competent banking supervisory authority BAKred and also by the competent tax authority . The BdB argues that the silent partnership of the Land of Hessen represented a formal abuse of a ' normal' silent partnership .
L868	Moreover , the usefulness of permanent innovative capital instruments as core capital above the 15 % limit is testified to by the practice of private banks as well in recent years , as was amply demonstrated by Germany . Nor does the Commission regard the selective criteria adduced by the BdB as sufficiently convincing . From the risk analysis point of view , the silent partnership of the Land of Hessen is more similar in type to a ' normal' silent partnership than to share capital . The Commission agrees with Germany 's comments here too . Article 111 CC : If the beginning of the time limit specified in days is a certain event , the day on which the event occurs will not be taken into account when calculating the time limit . The court may make deliveries by various methods : by post , via the court bailiff or court ushers , and also via the court delivery service . As a rule , however , writs are delivered by post ( Article 131 CCP ) . All these methods , provided that delivery has been effected correctly , are equally valid and the use of any one of them does not affect deadlines .
L869	A deadline is complied with if the procedural writ for which the deadline was set is received at court within that deadline , i.e. is submitted at the court 's day - book office ( with the date stamp being the determining factor ) or is deposited at a Post office run by the public operator in Poland . Similarly , the date of payment of the court fee by bank transfer effected at a foreign bank is the date of receipt of the payment order by the national bank serving as the foreign bank 's correspondent . Compliance with the deadline for completing the action is determined not by the date on which the writ is dispatched abroad , but by the date on which it is transferred to a Polish post office . ( EC ) No 73/2009 Non - application of reductions and exclusions ( potentially eligible animals , animals without ear tags ) and serotyping of the relevant isolates shall take place in national reference laboratories for salmonella .

It is clarified that the margin of error of 20 % in the total number of direct PV jobs as estimated by the European PV association , which may apply upward or downward , became apparent during the verification visit at EPIA . It shows the difficulty to assess precise figures on employment in the downstream sector as there are few sources , often contradictory , of data collection . Despite these doubts , even if the original estimation of jobs was used to analyse the impact on the measures the following remarks must be made . The estimation covers the European PV jobs in 2011 , which was correlated with a very high number of PV installations in the Union that year ( about 20 GW ) .

I shall now turn to the questions from the court of reference and consider whether limitation of the carry - over period to eighteen months is compatible with EU law .

This decline in consumption would allegedly be linked to changes in fashion trends that have moved from formal towards more casual footwear . Accordingly , the consumer has switched preference in favour of low price segment typically represented by imports from third countries . In this context the investigation has shown that there has been a decrease in consumption of product concerned . However , if there had been full substitutability between leather shoes and other materials , this decrease would have been much more pronounced . The decrease in consumption and changes in consumer preference would therefore not on its own appear to be a factor that would break the causal link .
L897	The large volumes of dumped products have most certainly been a key factor in developing and maintaining this price pressure . " Can the same be said of the ladies ?

" Now ! " said Haplo , keeping watch , waiting until the last elf had left the Factree . He shoved the plate aside , pulled himself up onto the floor . Bane 's face was flushed , his eyes shone with excitement . Haplo cast a swift glance around , wondering why he hesitated . Unless , of course , the elves had been forewarned of their coming and were lying in wait . But that was a risk they had to take , and not much of a risk at that . Thanks , guys . How about a latte ?

Conclusion on causation The analysis above shows a substantial increase in volume and market share of the dumped imports originating in Russia in the period considered and a parallel decrease of import prices over the same period . This increase in market share coincided with a significant drop in market share of the Union industry . As a consequence , the Union industry was not able to fully recover from the effects of past dumping practices by imports from of Brazil , China and Armenia and suffered material injury during the investigation period .
L912	The Commission distinguished and separated the effects of all known factors on the situation of the Union industry from the injurious effects of the dumped imports such as the effect of imports from other third countries , the development of Union consumption , the export performance of the Union industry , the activity of the Union industry in the ACF market and the cost of the raw material . However , taking into account the higher prices and the lower volume of Turkish imports in relation to the imports from Russia as well as the low levels of Chinese imports , it was concluded that these factors could not break the causal link established between the dumped imports from Russia and the injury suffered by the Union industry . On the basis of the above , the Commission concluded at this stage that the material injury to the Union industry was caused by the dumped imports from the country concerned and the other factors considered individually or collectively did not break the causal link . The injury consists mainly of financial losses and loss of market share in the Union market .

L924	The Commission , pursuant to Regulation No 17 and Regulation No 1/2003 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 EC and 82 EC , has a margin of discretion when fixing the amount of fines , in order that it may direct the conduct of undertakings towards compliance with the competition rules and that it may at any time adjust the level of fines to the needs of that policy . The Commission 's practice in previous decisions does not itself serve as a legal framework for the fines imposed in competition matters . Decisions in other cases can give only an indication for the purpose of determining whether there is discrimination , since the facts of those cases , such as markets , products , the undertakings and periods concerned , are not likely to be the same . The Commission assesses the gravity of infringements by reference to numerous factors , which are not based on a binding or exhaustive list of the criteria which must be applied . Nor is it bound to apply a precise mathematical formula , either for the total amount of the fine or where it is broken down into different elements .

Some interested parties have maintained that there are significant differences in terms of use and quality between different types of frozen strawberries .
L952	In recital 15 of the provisional Regulation , it was stated that the investigation has shown that despite differences in varieties , quality , size and post - processing , the different types of the product concerned , as well as the frozen strawberries produced and sold on the Community market by the Community industry , all share the same basic physical and biological characteristics and are basically used for the same purposes . They were therefore considered to constitute one single product . In the absence of any further comments regarding the product definition and the like product , the contents and provisional conclusions of recitals 12 to 16 of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed . Market Economy Treatment No comment was received that was apt to alter the findings on market economy treatment . It was n't a gang thing . I can tell you that . Angelina is a tramp and a liar .

L953	Article 325(4 ) TFEU empowers the European Parliament and the Council to adopt necessary measures in the fields of the prevention of and the fight against fraud affecting the Union 's financial interests .

It supersedes an earlier Commission proposal ( 3 ) . That 's how we knew to come here . My father made a map with that moon on it .

L954	Beware the blood - metal ! " The vast courtyard and immediate palace grounds were now a surging mass of bodies . Dull - red flashes signaled Firvulag and Tanu mind - screens interfacing in mutual collapse , after which the antagonists might fight hand to hand , with perfidious Lowlives attacking with the iron at every opportunity . The merest prick from the blood - metal meant death to a Tanu . Human gold - tores , of course , could be wounded by the blood - metal , but not mortally poisoned . Velteyn 's heart warmed at the bravery shown by the gold adoptees , many of whom seized iron weapons and turned them against the Firvulag . Unfortunately , it was otherwise with the grays and silvers . The discipline of the tor c faded in the face of diminished coercion from beleagured Tanu overlords . The lower echelons among the human levies were unmanned by the demoralizing sight of Tanu knights falling to the iron . Both Firvulag and Lowlives seized the advantage and decimated the ranks of the terror - stricken troops . But as the sky beyond the Black Forest massif paled , two powerful bodies of the Foe , spearheaded by files Four - Fang and Nukalavee , made a great press and reached the palace gate .

L957	The relevant Member State shall inform the other Member States of any authorisation rejected . In order to avoid delays , participants should start discussions as early as possible with Rapporteur Member States in order to resolve uncertainties in relation to data requirements . Applicants , other than participants , who wish to apply in accordance with Article 11 of Directive 98/8/EC for inclusion in Annex I , IA or IB thereto of an active substance / product type combination being evaluated under the review programme should submit complete dossiers for that combination no earlier or no later than participants so as not to disturb the smooth functioning of the review programme or create a disadvantage to the participants . The requirements concerning the content and format of dossiers and the number of dossiers to be submitted should be defined . Provision should be made for cases in which a participant is joined by a producer , formulator or association and in which a participant withdraws from the review programme . Subject to the same time - limits , it should also be possible in certain circumstances for Member States to indicate an interest and act as a participant for the inclusion in Annex I , IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC of such a combination . For the same purpose , a person or Member State taking over the role of participant should provide within a certain period evidence of commencing work on a complete dossier .
L958	It should be possible , in exceptional circumstances , for the Rapporteur Member States to establish a new deadline for the submission of parts of a dossier , in particular where the participant has demonstrated that it was impossible to submit information in due time or in order to resolve uncertainties regarding data requirements that remain despite earlier discussions between the participant and the Rapporteur Member State . For each existing active substance , the Rapporteur Member State should examine and evaluate the dossier and present the results to the Commission and the other Member States in the form of a competent authority report and a recommendation as to the decision to be taken with regard to the active substance concerned . In order not to prolong decision - making unnecessarily , the Rapporteur Member State should at the same time consider carefully the need for additional studies . The competent authority reports should be examined by the other Member States before the assessment reports are submitted to the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products . Where , despite a recommendation for inclusion of an active substance in Annex I , IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC , concerns as referred to in Article 10(5 ) of that Directive remain , it should be possible for the Commission to take into account , but without prejudice to Article 12 of that Directive , the finalisation of the evaluation on other existing active substances applied for the same use .

QUALITY MANAGEMENT ( ART . 11 - 13 ) Eleven Member States have ensured that each blood establishment institutes and maintains a quality system based on the principles of good practice .
L961	Nine Member States reported that blood establishments are required to maintain documentation on operational procedures , guidelines , training and reference manuals , and reporting forms and provide access to these documents for officials entrusted with inspection and control . Most Member States have procedures in place to ensure that blood establishments maintain records of their annual activities , basic testing requirements , and the information provided to and obtained from donors as well as donor suitability requirements . However , the time frame for maintaining these records differs from the 15-year minimum the Directive requires . Three States require records to be kept for 10 years , one stipulates a retention time of 50 years . One Member State indicated that its blood donation centres were not aware that records had to be kept for this length of time . Eight Member States were aware that the competent authority had to keep records of data received from blood establishments related to their authorisation , provisions for those already existing , inspection and control , the responsible person and adverse events and reactions . Note 3 In case of amendments , the referenced standard is EN CCCCC : YYYY , its previous amendments , if any , and the new , quoted amendment . The superseded standard ( column 3 ) therefore consists of EN CCCCC : YYYY and its previous amendments , if any , but without the new quoted amendment .
L962	So when x is 0 , f of x is there . When x is 1 , f of x is there . In that regard , however , it is necessary to note that , according to settled case - law , the procedure for a preliminary ruling provided for under Article 267 TFEU is not concerned with the interpretation of national laws or regulations , and that , consequently , any inaccuracies in the description of the relevant national provisions given by the national court in its judgment requesting a preliminary ruling can not have the effect of depriving the Court of jurisdiction to reply to the question referred . ( 10 ) In the present case , I consider that , on the basis of the information contained in the order for reference , the Court has before it the factual and legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the question submitted . Hard to believe there are so many cars out on the roads . Should n't they be at home getting ready ? The basis of my own addiction , I know , is my simple human need for Darcy to get off with Elizabeth .

They are my chosen representatives in the field of shagging , or , rather , courtship .
L963	I would hate to see Darcy and Elizabeth in bed , smoking a cigarette afterwards . That would be unnatural and wrong and I would quickly lose interest . And what are you going to do ? If , however , the referring court were to have sufficient freedom of action to assess whether a purely artificial arrangement existed in the case in the main proceedings , inter alia on the basis of other provisions of German tax law , it would be for it to determine whether Columbus had an actual establishment in Belgium intended to carry on genuine economic activities in that Member State , on the basis of objective and ascertainable factors relating , inter alia , to the extent to which Columbus physically existed in terms of premises , staff and equipment . It is only if that was not the case that the national measure at issue , as applied in the present case , would be justified in order to prevent wholly artificial arrangements .

L975	If a debtor fails to comply voluntarily with a legal judgment , the claimant can enforce compliance through the courts ; this is known as compulsory enforcement . It requires an enforceable title ( Article 1386 of the Judicial Code ) , because it involves an intrusion into the debtor 's personal legal sphere . Such a title will usually be a judgment or a notarial deed . This is a means of exerting pressure on the person convicted in order to encourage compliance with a legal judgment . A penalty payment can not , however , be imposed in certain cases : when the person has been sentenced to pay a sum of money or to comply with an employment contract and when it would be incompatible with human dignity . A penalty payment is enforced on the basis of the title providing for it and no further title is therefore required . In the case of a person sentenced to pay a sum of money , the claim is enforced against the debtor 's assets and is referred to as attachment . Does the claimant have to go through a professional intermediary to bring the case to court , or place a claim through the competent authority ? Representation by a lawyer is not required in maintenance cases . The claimant may choose to act on his / her own behalf or through a professional intermediary . If so , how much are they likely to be ?
L976	If the financial means of the claimant are insufficient , can he / she obtain legal aid to cover the costs of the procedure ? Under Polish law the person seeking enforcement of a maintenance claim is exempt from bearing court costs . This exemption is total , i.e. the person concerned does not pay any court costs , appeal costs or enforcement costs . In addition , a person enjoying exemption from court costs may apply for legal aid in the form of a lawyer appointed by the court . If the application for a lawyer is granted , the lawyer 's fees are covered by the opponent of the party for whom a lawyer is appointed . Where that person loses the case , the lawyer 's costs are borne by the State Treasury . The rights of Member State nationals in this matter are regulated by the Act on the right to assistance in civil proceedings conducted in Member States of the European Union . Information on this Act is contained in the information provided by Poland on legal aid . How is the level of maintenance calculated in court proceedings ? How do changes in the cost of living and family circumstances affect the level of the allowance ? And as far as Sam not playing in the game , that 's his fault . What ? No , not anymore .

L990	By Decision of 20 May 2015 ( 12 ) , the Commission concluded that there was no reason to require that the Authority withdraw that opinion . Consequently , it has not been established that the preparation of Bacillus cereus var . toyoi ( NCIMB 40112/CNCM I-1012 ) , which has been re - classified as a new species named Bacillus toyonensis ( NCIMB 14858 T ) , does not have an adverse effect on animal health or on human health , when used as feed additive . The conditions for authorisation , as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation ( EC ) No 1831/2003 , are therefore not satisfied . For the same reasons , the conditions for authorisation of the preparation of Bacillus cereus var . toyoi ( NCIMB 40112/CNCM I-1012 ) as a feed additive for use for turkeys for fattening and for rabbit breeding does are no longer fulfilled and those authorisations should be revoked . Implementing Regulation ( EU ) No 288/2013 should also be repealed . Since existing stocks of the preparation of Bacillus cereus var . toyoi ( NCIMB 40112/CNCM I-1012 ) , of premixtures containing that preparation and of feed materials and compound feed produced from that preparation were already to be withdrawn from the market according to Article 7 of Implementing Regulation ( EU ) No 288/2013 , no transitional measures should be provided for .

The applicant adds that at the time the participation of the Republic of Turkey in a Customs Union with the Community was not expected for 10 years . Its production unit began operations in 1993 . Following the entry into force of the Customs Union on 1 January 1996 , all customs taxes and duties and other charges affecting the import of ball bearings and housings were lifted .

L1021	The content of the two provisions being essentially identical , the method indicated by the Commission led the appellant to the erroneous conclusion that , in Community law , time - limits should always be computed in the same manner , that is to say , by adding an additional day to the time - limit , given that the day of notification was not included in the calculation . That error was reason why the action before the General Court was lodged out of time . 8 Moreover , the appellant attempted to verify that its calculation was correct by approaching the Commission to obtain written confirmation of the date of notification of the contested decision . After receiving that confirmation , it contacted the Registry of the General Court to seek confirmation that its calculation of the time - limit was correct . It was informed that it was not possible to reply to its request .

However , it must be held that , although the applicant did make such a claim , the conduct of the institution concerned , namely the Court of First Instance , did not induce it to act in that way . 20 Secondly , the rules concerning the time - limits applicable in the present case are clear and interpretation of them presents no particular difficulty ... 21 Thirdly , the applicant did not display diligence , in particular , in seeking confirmation form the Registry of calculation of the time - limit which it had made for the purpose of commencing an action within the prescribed time - limit .

Funds available Policy stages Topics Funds management Evaluation Glossary Key objectives The European Fund for Regional Development ( EFRD ) , the European Social Fund ( ESF ) and the Cohesion Fund contribute to three objectives : Convergence , Regional Competitiveness and Employment , and European Territorial Cooperation in the following way : In the EU , this objective concerns - within 18 Member States - 84 regions with a total population of154 million , and per capita GDP at less than 75 % of the Community average , and - on a " phasing - out " basis - another 16 regions with a total of 16.4 million inhabitants and a GDP only slightly above the threshold , due to the statistical effect of the larger EU . In the EU , a total of 168 regions will be eligible , representing 314 million inhabitants . of these , 13 regions which are home to a total of 19 million inhabitants represent so - called " phasing - in " areas and are subject to special financial allocations due to their former status as Objective 1 regions . The amount of EUR 55 billion - of which EUR 11.4 billion is for the " phasing - in " regions - represents just below 16 % of the total allocation . This objective concerns regions in 19 Member States .
R9	269 Furthermore , OA complains that the Commission did not define the relevant markets and analyse the conditions of competition on those markets . The conclusion that the contested measure distorts competition is not only not justified , but is also erroneous . 33 of the 38 Greek airports are operated by OA on the basis of public service obligations , without any competition , and thirty of these airports do not have any commercial interest . 270 The Commission contends that the premature payment at issue constitutes in itself State aid . The applicants do not put forward any compelling reason on which a private investor could have created a firm and genuine hope that , from that early payment , it would obtain a satisfactory profit in view of OA 's particularly difficult situation , characterised by the grant of aid for the company for several years , unsuccessful attempts at restructuring and sale , the persistence of negative results and the combination of debts and losses . In addition , OA 's private creditors , such as aircraft lessors and ABN Amro and Crédit Lyonnais , requested guarantees from the Hellenic Republic . Furthermore , it is apparent from the Moore Stephens report that the premature payment at issue was used to finance operating costs , such as the rental of aircraft leased to NOA by OA .

They relied on the accountancy data provided by the Greek authorities and applied recognised accounting practices when they subtracted in particular the dubious debts , the return on future sales of aircraft , and the goodwill , taking into account the total amount of debts , the depreciation of aircraft costs , as well as estimates of certain revenue and expenditure in particular in the tax area . 274 The Commission , supported by the intervener , disputes that the conversion of the Olympic Airways group has its own book value . Go ! Go ! Look down .

R11	I 'm here with Miguel . I love spring break ! I want to dance ! The members of the Joint Undertaking shall have a number of votes in proportion to their contribution to the funds of the Joint Undertaking . There were , to a lesser extent , shortcomings in the programmes in the United Kingdom , Slovenia , Finland , Sweden and Latvia . Even if the Commission 's audits detected improvements in all Member States in 2007 - 2010 , the Commission still remains cautious at closure and asked all programmes bodies to report on follow - up ( including financial corrections ) which they have made at national level for all reported irregularities in each programme . There is a risk that the reported data on financial corrections for the period 2000 - 2006 resulting from the work of the EU institutions ( audits by the Commission and the Court of Auditors and OLAF investigations ) will overlap with the same data reported by Member States on the basis of their checks . This is due to the fact that a large part of the financial corrections resulting from the work of EU bodies are accepted and implemented by the Member States without the Commission issuing a formal decision to exclude the expenditure concerned from the declarations of expenditure of these Member States .
R12	Whereas Member States are not obliged to distinguish between corrections resulting from the work of the EU bodies and the corrections resulting from the controls and audits carried out by those Member States themselves during the period 2000 - 2006 , the extent of this overlap can not be precisely quantified . In addition , the actual implementation by the Member State may not be in the same year the Member State accepts the financial correction . The potential overlap is therefore only an estimate . The comparison of data reported by the Member States for 2010 and the amounts of corrections resulting from the work of EU bodies accepted by the Member States during the same year indicate that the overlap can not exceed EUR 65 million ( 2009 : EUR 465 million ) . For the 2007 - 2013 programming period , the legislation for Member States is required to report annually on recoveries and withdrawals via IT systems SFC2007 . Attempted murder - that 's hardly what we 're going to do to him . That 's not a question . I can say it in such a way as to be a question .

R14	Since 30 June 2011 , the Bank has 10 branches and 24 branches . The bank also represented , with a market share of 4,2 % , the seventh largest bank in terms of the volume of the loan portfolio and the same market share as the tenth largest bank in terms of deposit volume . MLB has a dual role , as it is both a developing and commercial bank . In recent years , however , it has become the main intermediary of state - supported credit programmes , such as small and medium - sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , start - ups , agriculture and rural areas , and business activities of socially disadvantaged communities . The Bank is currently undergoing a restructuring process , i.e. gradually turning into a purely development bank , while its commercial activities are gradually limited and should be completely discontinued by December 2013 at the latest . In June 2009 , Moody 's reduced the bank 's financial strength rating to E+ ( this is a very low actual financial strength with a higher probability of regular external support ) , which , according to the latest available MLB report of 22 June 2011 , did not change . In view of this , the Latvian authorities decided to intervene in MLB in the interests of financial stability .

R16	many of the mills that were no longer working were placed along the watercourses and also produced flour ; they were equipped with multi - purpose millstones . With the advancement of technical progress and the knowledge transmitted , the huskers today use specific equipment , adjusted according to individual lots , and make it possible to obtain a greater yield for peeling , due to the lower grains broken during the course of this activity and during the sorting process . The skill in doing so consists in determining the length of husking in an expedient manner . Historically , several prehistoric prehistoric settlements have already shown traces of small spelt in the Haute Provence area . Roman settlements of ' Provincia' ( Provence ) have shifted this crop into ' unrepented' forests in the hinterland . Small spelt , because of its resilience and the possibility of easy preservation , made it possible for these people to survive . Since then , official documents ( 1338 ) , investigations ( 1775 ) and agricultural statistics ( 1804 - 1874 ) show the presence of this crop in different locations of Haute Provence . view information for a data item the tribunal wrongly held that the mere application for an intellectual property right which would take effect only 5 to 6 years later , irrespective of whether the law is ultimately granted or enforced , constitutes an act intended to restrict competition .
R17	This is because the conduct is too isolated or remote from the allegedly affected market . second abuse of a dominant position : withdrawal of the marketing authorisation . The grounds of appeal in respect of the second abuse of a dominant position are divided into two main parts . The Tribunal wrongly ruled that the exercise of an unlimited right under Community law infringes competition on the merits . Second , the General Court erred in law as to why the conduct of restricting competition is based . the Tribunal wrongly held that the mere execution of a right under Community law was intended to restrict competition . In the alternative , if the Court considers that the exercise of a right conferred by Community law may in principle lead to abuse , a mere tendency to distort competition is not sufficient to conclude that there is an abuse . The appellants claim that the Commission must be invited to demonstrate that the exercise of the right which they have legally conferred on them was intended to eliminate effective competition . This would be in line with the conditions in cases involving compulsory licences , which the second abuse relates to . fines . The punishment for violation of Articles 1 and 2 will be swift and ruthless . so you do n't think anything else . Drink a glass and do n't spill anything .

R38	The second method of comparison focused on the so - called paralogic proteins , which came from a common ancestor within a certain creature as a result of gene duplications . Both types of comparisons showed that new proteins came from elders , just as evolutionary theory would have predicted . Duplicate parts of DNA genome occur constantly in all organisms , predominantly as a result of incidental breakthroughs and reconnecting . Most of these duplicated sections are doomed because all the proteins that their genes create are unnecessary . Occasionally , a slightly modified gene product can be shown to be adaptively advantageous and a new protein is produced . her function is often very similar to the previous one , but every now and then there are dramatic changes . of DNA sequencing began widely in 1978 . new genetic information flooded the almost immediately existing database of protein sequences . a second databank , GenBank , was established , but initially it focused exclusively on DNA sequences . and yet interesting information was contained in translated DNA sequences , that is , in their protein equivalents .

English departments need fewer translators , since most internal documents are written in English . The level of external translation and surpluses shall be decided by management . It can be attributed to a high percentage of legislative documents requiring particular attention , combined with demand fluctuations ( the daily workload in 2003 was less than 1 000 to more than 7 000 pages ) . In order to address the problem of overcapacity , DG A III adopted a long - term action plan to reduce the number of translation and secretaries in the EU-15 languages from 50 FTE in 2002 to 25 FTE in 2015 ( 33 ) . However , the full impact of the plan is a long - term issue , as the Council argues that the possibilities for internal transfers are limited and interinstitutional mobility is low . This seemingly low productivity could be explained to some extent by editing the originals and the role of English as a pilot language for translations of texts from the EU-10 languages , causing a significant increase in terminology problems .

The Commission states that such an approach does not take into account alternatives to investment outside the company , which any investor would have assessed in the light of the absolute and relative value of the investment in question in the context of the transaction at issue . In the view of the Commission , the fact that public authorities have a shareholding in a given undertaking is not sufficient for any further capital injection is automatically regarded as compatible with the principles of the market economy . In any event , a market economy investor would like to know whether , in any event , his total investment made up of the funds already made and the new capital injection can expect a reasonable return . The Section for Economic and Monetary Union and Economic and Social Cohesion , which was responsible for preparing the Committee 's work on the subject , adopted its opinion on 24 April 2013 .

Similarly , it should be welcomed that all instruments create additional guarantees for minors .
R58	However , although a person defined as a minor enjoys such guarantees , there is insufficient protection for those applicants for international protection whose age is challenged by the Member State receiving the applicant , processing the application and deciding on it or applying the Dublin criteria ; notes that material reception conditions will be the first manifestation of the SEAS to be met by applicants for international protection . It is therefore essential that , where the age of the applicant is challenged , that applicant is treated as a minor until it has been established that he / she is not ( in compliance with the rights and security of other applicants for international protection ) to be treated in all circumstances in person and with dignity , and that legal safeguards concerning the procedures for determining age should be applied in particular where a medical examination is carried out .

Introduction In February 2005 , the United Kingdom Government , in the context of its Presidency of the Council from July to December 2005 , asked the EESC to draw up an exploratory opinion on Ethical Trade and consumer guarantee schemes and to support sustainable development initiatives .
R62	In particular , fair trade has been a matter of concern to the EESC , drawn up by the first opinion on this subject in 1996 ( 2 ) . It is therefore welcome that we have another opportunity to deal specifically with this topic . ' Ethical trade' may offer opportunities to address this tension . Consumers can , to a large extent , guide their consumption power , companies are very sensitive to consumer trends , and they also try to minimise the threat to their reputation . the potential leverage effect of ' ethical trade' is significant . The 100 largest economies of the world are 51 companies and 49 countries ( 3 ) . As regards possible derogations under Article 87(3 ) TEC , it should be noted that the project is not implemented in the field of aid under Article 87(3)(a ) or ( c ) of the EC Treaty . As a result , regional aid is not taken into account . While the measure in question was granted before the entry into force of Regulation ( EC ) No 364/2004 , Regulation ( EC ) No 70/2001 is applicable in its amended version since , under Article 9a , the individual aid granted before the entry into force of Regulation ( EC ) No 364/2004 is not authorised by the Commission in breach of the notification requirement in Article 88(3 ) , Subject to the requirements of Regulation ( EC ) No 70/2001 as amended .
R63	Whereas the current project concerns the development of a prototype and two installations to be used in production , it is neither basic research nor research applied . The same article defines precompetitive development as the transfer of the knowledge of industrial research into a project , scheme or design of new , modified or improved products , processes or services , whether or not they are intended to be sold or used , including the creation of a first prototype intended for non - commercial purposes . On the other hand , the development of a prototype may , in the Commission 's view , be regarded as a precompetitive development . not applicable in production because it was dismantled in 2003 . Moreover , Magog was also granted patents following the application of the project . Under Article 5a(3 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 70/2001 , the allowable maximum aid intensity for pre - competitive development aid for small and medium - sized enterprises is 35 % of the eligible costs of the project .

The Commission has further developed a fully - fledged strategy[13 ] on the external competitiveness of EU industry to benefit from the benefits of globalisation and to ensure a more favourable international environment for European businesses . The majority of the horizontal and sectoral initiatives described in the 2005 Communication are long - term projects that will be continued over the period 2007 - 2009 . Overall , recent economic developments , as well as experience and feedback on key pillars of the 2005 industrial policy , show that this policy does not need to be fundamentally altered .

R76	In order to safeguard financial stability , it is necessary to identify , at an early stage , trends , potential risks and vulnerabilities stemming from micro - level internationally and across sectors . In order to report on the fulfilment of their functions , the Authority should carry out an economic analysis of the markets and the impact that potential market developments could have on those markets . The Authority should act as an independent advisory body to the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission in its field of competence . should be able to provide an opinion on the prudential assessment of mergers and acquisitions under Directive 2006/48/EC . In order to effectively carry out his duties , the Authority should have the right to request all necessary information relating to the prudential supervision . In order to avoid duplication of reporting obligations for financial institutions , this information should normally be submitted by national supervisory authorities as close as possible to financial markets and institutions , taking into account already existing statistics . However , the Authority should be able to submit , as a last resort , a duly justified request for information directly to financial institutions ▐ where the national competent authority does not or can not provide that information in a timely manner . Member States ' authorities should be obliged to assist the Authority in enforcing these direct requests . That 's too much , Chloe .

If I do not qualify for legal aid , can I appeal against this decision ? What are the costs of a trial and who should normally pay them ? The various costs of a trial , and the rules for bearing these costs are regulated differently for civil and criminal proceedings . a ) Costs of a trial at civil proceedings : These costs may , for example , include the cost of preliminary enquiries and exchange of letters , charge for proceedings , fees of witnesses and experts , fees of trustees and interpreters , cost of local trial and inquiry .
R78	The court awards costs in the final decision on the substance of the case , in which , as a general rule , the losing party is obliged to pay for the costs of the successful party . Under the Act the court may , as an exception , refrain from ordering the losing party to pay the costs of the trial or to pay part of them , but may oblige the persons concerned to bear the costs immediately ( for example , if the witness , expert , or other any person not involved in the trial has to be ordered to pay the costs of an action of the trial ) . The court may take similar action if one of the parties bears the cost of any act of the trial without regard to the decision in the trial ( e.g. where the party carries out acts of the trial unsuccessfully or is unjustifiably late with certain actions of the trial or misses a date or a deadline or causes unnecessary costs in any other way ) . if the costs that one of the parties has to bear before the decision on the substance of the case , this cost has to be paid on the party 's behalf in advance . b ) Costs of a trial in criminal proceedings : Procedure Community producers may lodge a written request for a review .

If I do not qualify for legal aid , can I appeal against this decision ? What are the costs of a procedure and who is normally paying them ? The costs of a civil proceeding are court fees and , if required , fees for experts , interpreters , witnesses and guardians appointed by the court ( as representatives for absent parties or parties in need of guardianship ) , the parties' travelling expenses , and costs of announcements and representation by a lawyer . These lists shall be published on an official website of the Member State , in the format established in consultation between the Member States and the Commission .

" Phenytoin ( medicine used in the treatment of fits and irregularities of heart rhythm ) At the initiation or end of concomitant treatment with lansoprazole , caution and monitoring of phenytoin plasma concentrations is recommended . Warfarin ( a medicine used to reduce clotting of the blood ) Theophylline ( a medicine used to treat asthma ) Lansoprazole reduces theophylline plasma concentration . If the two medicines are combined with caution , caution is advised . the administrative costs related to the collection of taxes and the tax compliance costs are relatively high .
R81	In spite of several measures taken to address these problems , Bulgaria still lacks a fully - fledged tax compliance strategy to guide the operation of all tax - collecting bodies , which would include a preliminary analysis of the most important risks associated with the collection of taxes and the assessment of measures already in place , including simplification measures and better controls . ( 11 ) In 2013 Bulgaria abandoned its past commitments in the area of pension reform . Other early retirement systems have been introduced , and the planned annual increase of the statutory retirement age has been postponed . No progress has been made in the field of unification of the retirement age for men and women and no measures have been taken to tighten the criteria for the award of invalidity pensions and checks to avoid the unjustified award of invalidity pensions . Bulgaria must therefore continue the reform of its pension system . In addition , the high level of official and unofficial charges borne directly by patients in essence prevents certain groups of the population from access to healthcare . The health status indicators are wrong compared to other Member States and show that structurally higher public expenditure on health could be required in the future . he let her go again . and invited her to dinner .

By declaration made to the civil registrar , he may again adopt his name at birth or the name which he used until the married name was determined , or he may place his name at birth in front of the married name or add it to the married name ( Section 1355(5 ) BGB ) . The will in favour of the spouse is invalid in this case , unless the testator made it also to cover the event of divorce ( Section 2077 BGB ) . There is an exception if the division of the increase in value would be grossly unfair . This may be the case in particular if the spouse who has achieved the smaller increase in value has for a relatively long period culpably failed to comply with the economic requirements arising from the matrimonial relationship ( Section 1381 BGB ) . If the spouses have agreed upon community of property , they must divide their entire property . In the case of a divorce on the part of the husband who is responsible for the divorce , they are not anticipated . The matrimonial residence is possible , if the spouses fail to agree , be assigned to one of the spouses .
R83	In this case , the court decides in its reasonable discretion . The household that is in joint ownership must be divided in a just and expedient manner by the court . On divorce by way of equalisation of provision , pension entitlements acquired by the spouses during the marriage ( e.g. entitlements under the statutory pension scheme , pension rights and entitlements to pension payments from the company pension scheme or from private pension insurance policies ) must be divided . 3.c ) the minor children of the spouses ( as regards parental responsibility and maintenance claims ) aa ) Parental responsibility If parents have joint care of their children and get divorced , the joint care continues .

R87	If the creditor 's claim has been adversely affected by a legal act on the part of the debtor , the creditor is able , under certain conditions , to challenge this legal act by court proceedings , to have it declared invalid and to claim the assets which the debtor has removed from creditor satisfaction in order to cover his claim . execution on the debtor 's bank credit balances is effected by attachment and transfer : the approval for enforcement contains an order forbidding the institution where the account is held from making payment to the debtor and an order forbidding the debtor from disposing of the claim against the institution . attached receivables are realised by transfer . The order confirming the application for a transfer gives the enforcing creditor the right to demand payment from the third - party debtor ( the institution where the account is held ) , if necessary by proceedings . If the bank makes payments to the account holder , although the account has been attached , such payments do not have the effect of discharging its debt .

Compatibility with the common market As the notified measure constitutes State aid , it is necessary to determine whether the aid is compatible with the common market under the exceptions provided for in Article 87(2 ) and ( 3 ) .
R90	Similarly , the exemptions provided for in Article 87(3)(a ) , ( b ) or ( d ) do not apply because the aid does not work in a region where the standard of living is abnormal or high unemployment . It is also necessary to examine the measure in accordance with the General Guidelines for the examination of State aid to fisheries and aquination ( 4 ) . According to point 1.2 of these Guidelines , State aid that is granted without imposing any obligation on the part of the beneficiaries and which is intended to improve the situation of undertakings and increase their business liquidity and leads to an increase in the income of the beneficiaries , as operating aid is incompatible with the common market . For the purposes of establishing compatibility with the common market , the Court of Justice has held that the Commission is bound by the guidelines and communications it has adopted in the field of State aid control , where they do not depart from the rules of the Treaty and are accepted by the Member States ( 5 ) . Second , under Article 253 of the EC Treaty , the Commission has to give reasons for its decisions , including decisions by which it refuses to declare aid compatible with the common market on the basis of Article 92(3)(b ) of the EC Treaty .

R128	civil and criminal cases have a different measure of proof , whereby in civil cases , the Courts shall determine the proving of a fact on the balance of probabilities . In civil cases , the Courts examine the evidence produced , with a view to determine which fact occurred according to the claim / defence brought forward . In criminal cases , the courts need to ascertain whether the proof brought forward , beyond reasonable doubt attributes guilt to the person charged or accused . II . A person can bring an action against another by means of a writ of summons . The same Procedural Code , stipulates that should a witness not be mentioned at this stage , i.e. prior to the actual pleadings before Court , no further evidence can be brought forward , unless authorisation is given by the Court hearing the case . In the interest of the best administration of justice , the Court may of its own motion , upon for instance , identifying a need to appoint an expert witness to determine a technical issue , appoint a referee to this end .

It is necessary to assess the duration of the infringement in question in the light of the Commission 's errors which led JCB Service legitimately to take the view that its distribution network did not infringe the competition rules . In such a context , since the duration of the infringement is an aspect justifying the amount of the fine , the duration of the contested practices must not be regarded as an aspect to be applied in order to increase the amount which remains an unjustified fine . 223 That argument is irrelevant . It should be noted that the Commission 's assessment of the duration of the infringement found concerns non - notified agreements and practices .
R130	In the light of the documents examined , which concern two elements of the infringement considered as established in the judgment under appeal and which took place in 1992 , the Court of First Instance can not claim that the infringement began in 1988 or in paragraph 184 of the judgment under appeal that ' the Commission referred to the facts relating to those two elements of the infringement which are proven and that ' the evidence previously examined is presented in the file . relating to the overall period under examination , without actually examining the evidence . 225 It must be held that , in essence , JCB Service merely complains that the Court of First Instance did not take over or disclose all the evidence enabling the infringement to be established . It does not , however , prove that the Court of First Instance erred in law in paragraph 184 of the judgment under appeal by confirming the Commission 's finding as to the duration of the infringement . In fact , JCB Service has not put forward any argument to show that the Commission 's assessment in the present case departs from point 1 of Part B of the Guidelines . 226 Finally , JCB Service submits that the Court of First Instance did not sanction the fact that , in the present case , the Commission did not accept attenuating circumstances within the meaning of Section 3 of the Guidelines .

Secondary acts can not contradict a law . Resolutions of the Seimas ( Lithuanian Parliament ) Government resolutions Instructions and orders of ministerial departments Resolutions and decisions of local authorities and administrative institutions Others Interpretative legal acts are adopted for the purposes of demonstrating the meaning and substance of legal provisions in force . individual acts have legal consequences similar to regulatory legal acts , but they are not granted the status of sources of law since they do not establish commonly applicable rules of a general nature , and the provisions incorporated in them are aimed at specific persons in specific cases and are applicable only once , that is , they are valid only until the social circumstances to which they relate cease to exist ( appointment to a post , warning , award of a pension etc . ) .
R134	General principles of law ( principles of good faith , justice , individual responsibility , moderation ) are considered an integral part of the Lithuanian legal system and are used as a basis for interpreting statutory legal acts and filling legislative gaps . Furthermore , under Section 135(1 ) of the Lithuanian Constitution , universally recognised principles of international law also form part of the Lithuanian legal system , and Lithuanian courts are therefore obliged to apply and observe these principles . Legal conventions - these are rules of conduct authorised by the State which have emerged in the public domain as a consequence of their repeated and enduring application . The Lithuanian Civil Code lays down that such conventions are a direct source of law . custom may be used where a law or a treaty directly specifies that it should be applied or where there is a legal regulatory gap . a custom which is contrary to general principles of law or imperative legal rules is not applicable .

Legal STATEMENT OF THE PROPOSAL Summary of the proposed action The proposal calls on the Member States to adopt a common approach at European level through the SP in the field of NCH research , in particular ACH . The SP will require interested Member States to work together to establish a common vision of the needs and opportunities of research in this area and , on this basis , develop a Strategic Research Agenda setting priorities , milestones and timetables , including an implementation plan describing the actions , instruments and resources needed to implement this strategic plan and to meet a common vision . use of an anti - subsidy instrument in transition countries .

R153	Spain 3 . We 'll unload the baggage at the hotel . First , but I 'll check the reservation . 72 Article 5(4 ) provides that ' an official who is the holder of a family and who has not established himself at the place where he is employed shall receive only half of the allowance to which he would have been entitled . Incidentally , he misled the administration by maintaining that he continued to meet the conditions for obtaining the daily subsistence allowances at issue . 73 Since the applicant confirmed in the application and at the hearing that the family had joined him in Brussels since 1 September 1997 , he was not in a situation covered by Article 5(4 ) of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations . It should have duly lodged one application for a full installation allowance and , at the same time , connected its lease agreement and applied for a residence permit from the month of September . In this case , the administration would have paid him this contribution in a single payment , but would not have paid the daily allowances . 74 At the hearing , the applicant stated that he had reported to the administration on 9 September 1997 that his family had moved to his new place of employment , so that he could not be criticised for hiding that status from her .
R154	In addition , he sent the invoice relating to the removal which had allegedly taken place on 2 March 1998 , the authenticity of which was challenged by both OLAF and the Commission in order to , as he himself admits , ' be able to obtain a daily subsistence allowance' . 77 As regards the applicant 's alleged good faith , which he sought to show by the fact that the actual removal took place only on 2 March 1998 , the day after the end of the period covered by the daily subsistence allowances in question , which he intended to ask ' in good faith ' , it must be borne in mind , in any event , that , in that situation , the applicant should have had doubts as to the merits of the payments in question .

Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party 's making itself known within the aforementioned period . Since the capital goods involving the VAT paid by Uusikaupunki in connection with the works and repairs were not used initially or partly for the purposes of the taxable transaction , the scope of the initial deduction was zero .
R165	The subsequent change in circumstances which were initially decisive for determining the amount of the deduction , namely the use for taxable transactions , must therefore be taken into account , in line with the above interpretation , by means of a correction in order to achieve the widest possible agreement between the range of activities subject to tax and the right to deduct .

R175	on the first and second questions , which relate to the condition that the acts of reproduction must form an integral and essential part of the technological process 29 By the first and second questions , which it is appropriate to examine together , the referring court asks , in essence , whether Article 5(1 ) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that temporary acts of reproduction carried out during the data collection process , such as those at issue in the main proceedings , must be interpreted as meaning : They meet the condition that such acts must be an integral and essential part of a technological process . In that regard , it asks , in particular , whether it is necessary to take into account the stage of the technological process in which those acts take place , and the fact that the technology process involves human intervention . 30 The concept of an ' integral and essential part of a technological process' requires that temporary acts of reproduction must be carried out in the context of a technological process and thus not be carried out , in whole or in part , outside the scope of such a process . That concept also presupposes that the carrying out of a temporary act of reproduction is necessary , in the sense that the technological process in question can not function correctly and effectively ( see , to that effect , Infopaq International , paragraph 61 ) .
R176	32 Similarly , there is nothing in that provision to suggest that a given technological process should not involve human intervention and , in particular , that that process could not be initiated manually for the purpose of acquiring the first temporary copy . 33 In the present case , it should be borne in mind that the technological process at issue consists in carrying out electronic and automatic searches in press articles , in the identification of predetermined keywords in those articles , and in the creation of extracts containing those keywords in order to streamline the processing of the articles in the press . 34 In that context , three acts of reproduction gradually take place .

The purpose of the HICP is to facilitate international comparison of consumer price inflation . They serve as important indicators for the management of monetary policy . The HICP represents a relatively comprehensive conceptual framework . Since the adoption of the initial implementing measures , significant progress has already been made in harmonising methodologies , but the space of non - comparability remains with regard to the identification of selections for detection , substitution , qualitative adjustment and aggregation procedures . An existing HICP defines the HICP as a Lsmiyres - type index , which describes the changing purchasing power of money in acquiring goods and services for the purpose of directly satisfying consumer demand . The HICP concerns the prices of all products purchased by consumers to maintain consumption patterns , i.e. products defined in basic expenditure categories ( weights ) .
R211	These categories consist of explicit consumption segments which are distinguishable according to the purpose of consumption . a set of all products offered in the statistical total file can be fully divided into consumption segments . consumer segments are relatively stable over time , although the products offered in the consumer segment vary with the development of the market . The concept of consumption segments according to purpose therefore plays a crucial role in selecting the sample and is of great importance for changes in value and for qualitative adjustment . The range of products offered will change over time , as retailers and producers are replacing and replacing products . This applies in particular to new models or variants of earlier models . The accreditation body shall supervise the accredited body and shall withdraw the accreditation by formal decision if the body no longer meets one or more of the accreditation criteria , unless the body makes the necessary remedial measures in a probationary period to be determined by the accreditation body according to the severity of the problem .

Compatibility with financial programming and financial perspective [ X ] The proposal is compatible with existing financial programming . The proposal will have to revise the relevant heading within the financial perspective . The proposal may require the application of the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement . 107 The Commission also submits that , under Paragraph 6 of the Bgld ArtenschutzVO , the provisions of that regulation are not affected by fishing and hunting . This provision therefore allows for deliberate damage to nests as well as to breeding , resting , resting and winter - protected species . 108 The Republic of Austria explains that the legislature of the Land adopted derogations on account of significant damage caused by the species concerned to the vine .
R216	As regards Paragraph 6 of the Bgld ArtenschutzVO , its last sentence can not be interpreted as providing for a general derogation in favour of hunting and fishing . Conclusions of the Court 110 As a preliminary point , it should be noted that the general system of protection laid down in Article 5 of the Directive applies , in accordance with the first sentence of that directive , to all species of birds referred to in Article 1 of that directive . The scheme includes , inter alia , a prohibition on deliberately killing , catching or disturbing protected species of birds . 111 As noted in paragraphs 90 and 91 above , the fact that the starlings are completely excluded from the system of protection laid down by the Directive between 15 July and 30 November is incompatible with Article 1 of that directive . 112 Consequently , the interventions authorised by the provisions referred to in paragraph 106 of the present judgment are also incompatible with the prohibitions set out in Article 5 of the Directive . 113 As regards the reason for the derogation relied on by the Republic of Austria , it is true that the prevention of damage to vines may , in principle , allow the adoption of derogating measures , on the basis of the third indent of Article 9(1)(a ) of the Directive .

R225	Therefore , in accordance with Article 2(3 ) of the basic Regulation , normal value was constructed on the basis of cost of production , plus a reasonable amount for selling , general and administrative costs and for profit . The sales , general and administrative costs and profit were determined on the basis of Mobras ' domestic sales of the product concerned . It is in this context that Mobras acquired the main part of the raw material for glyphosate production from a related company in Brazil . The level of profit of this related company was set at a lower level when determining the cost of securing the raw material for the calculation of the cost of production . The costs of selling , general and administrative costs and profits were based on actual data on sales of glyphosate in Mobras ' normal business activities .

Specific comments 5.1 Work on a toolbox for the implementation of the IMO decision setting the sulphur content of marine fuels in SECAs to a maximum of 0.1 % since 2015 . In this context , a detailed analysis of the availability of marine fuels with a sulphur content of 0,1 % , the use of emission abatement methods ( washing machines ) and the use of LNG as marine fuel have been carried out with the participation of different specialists . as far as accessibility is concerned , there is no clear solution . 5.2 The use of emission abatement methods ( washing machines / dishwashers ) is tested in different pilot projects . As a result of the simultaneous removal of NO2 and CO 2 emissions , such an installation can demonstrate its cost - effectiveness in the near future and must be taken into account . 78 Those pleadings are drawn up solely for the purposes of those proceedings and constitute an essential element of it . By the application initiating proceedings , the applicant defines the dispute and , in particular , in the written part of the procedure - as the oral procedure is not compulsory - the parties provide the Court with information on the basis of which the Court must issue its judicial decision .
R258	82 It follows that the Court of Justice 's exclusion from the scope of the institutions which , under Article 255 EC , are subject to those obligations is justified in the light of the nature of the judicial activity which it is required to exercise in accordance with Article 220 EC . 83 That interpretation is , moreover , also borne out by the broad logic in Regulation No 1049/2001 , the legal basis for which is Article 255 EC itself . Article 1(a ) of that regulation , which specifies the scope of that regulation , does not , by reason of the lack of reference to the Court of Justice , exclude from the scope of the institutions which are subject to the obligations of transparency which it lays down , and Article 4 of that regulation lays down one of the exceptions to the right of access to documents of the institutions specifically to protect court proceedings . 84 Consequently , it is clear both from Article 255 EC and from Regulation No 1049/2001 that the restriction of the application of the principle of transparency in relation to judicial activity pursues the same objective , consisting in guaranteeing that the exercise of the right of access to documents of the institutions does not impede the protection of court proceedings .

General principles of law These are principles established by the courts ; they may or may not stem from the provisions contained in instruments of written legislation .
R260	These principles are mostly taken from the Declaration of Human Rights of 1789 ( equality of citizens before the public authorities , freedom of conscience ) , the Preamble to the Constitution of 1946 , the necessities of social life ( continuity of public services , control of superior 's actions over the acts of his subordinates ) or the requirements of equity ( principle of unjust enrichment ) . case case law The Constitution in theory does not empower the courts to lay down general rules and their role is limited to settling disputes that are referred to them . In addition , it frequently occurs that there is no written instrument containing rules likely to apply to a particular dispute . In such a case , they can not refuse to give a ruling and the courts will themselves have to formulate the general rule enabling them to do so . The absence of a law of general scope may lead the courts to develop highly sophisticated sets of rules through case law , just as they do in the field of government liability . Oh , my God !

R261	Directive 2004/83 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third - country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted , the principle of effectiveness and the right to good administration do not preclude a national procedural rule making the examination of an application for subsidiary protection subject to the prior rejection of the application for refugee status and that national procedural rule does not result in an application for subsidiary protection being assessed within a disproportionate period , which it is for the referring court to ascertain . Whereas an applicant for international protection is not necessarily in a position to assess the type of protection covered by his application and that , moreover , refugee status provides wider protection than subsidiary protection , the application for subsidiary protection must not , in principle , be assessed before the competent authority concludes that an applicant for international protection does not satisfy the conditions justifying the grant of refugee status . Moreover , such a standard must ensure effective access by persons seeking subsidiary protection to the rights conferred on them by the Directive . " Was it bad ? " Cathy asked . To be honest ...

R262	The current Seventh Framework Programme , which brings together all Community research initiatives , provides less opportunities for aquaculture research than previous programmes . The European aquaculture technology and innovation platform has recently developed a European platform for aquaculture technology and innovation and expects it to define priorities in the European aquaculture sector with regard to research , development and innovation and to provide strategies to deliver them . 4.11.1 Safe and sustainable alternative ingredients of feed that meet the nutritional and biological needs of fish should be constantly sought , while allowing the positive nutritional value of the final product to be maintained . 4.12 The accessibility of veterinary medicinal products is also a major factor limiting the development of aquaculture . Currently , European aquaculture does not have sufficient access to veterinary medicinal products such as anaesthetics , vaccines or antibiotics . This reduces the viability of the sector and affects animal health and well - being , food safety and environmental protection . 4.13 The Commission communication proposes that the export of aquaculture production technologies to third countries be promoted . While this initiative has a degree of solidarity which is certainly to be supported , it should be borne in mind that future production obtained as a result of such export of technology will eventually be exported to the EU , where it will compete with domestic production .
R263	However , it can not be seen as completed work , but as a starting point for designing and developing specific actions to strengthen the sustainable development of aquaculture in the EU .

Consequently , excise duties are not , in principle , levied on imports of bottled wine and spirits . only domestic production and imports of bulk products filled in India are taxed ( the tax rate is significantly different in the 26 Indian national governments ) . In this context , on 1 April 2001 , by Notice No 37/2001 in Section 3 of the Customs Tariff Act , India introduced a federal additional customs duty on imported wines and spirits in order to compensate for excise duties paid or payable nationally on domestic products .

R280	" Our two units were too close together . Not applicable . 6.3 Shelf life 24 months . In the period since the previous report , progress has been made in a number of specific areas . In general , the availability and quality of the labour cost index ( ' LP' ) continued to improve . Progress has been made in the availability of seasonally adjusted data to the extent that in the near future the seasonally adjusted LCI may become the main benchmark in Eurostat press releases , as is already the case for all other macroeconomic statistics covering a period of less than one year . The national quality reports have increasingly been provided in time and almost all Member States are now sending metadata on a quarterly basis , providing explanations for changes in the data and useful related information . The index fluctuation has decreased , mainly due to improving hours worked data series , which continue to be closely monitored . The Commission ( Eurostat ) has also improved the availability of up - to - date data on the amount of hourly labour cost , using estimates that rely significantly on the labour cost index . the reaction of users to this change was very positive . The Member States participated in these activities and shared their experiences . Despite all positive developments , there are still a number of challenges that require some Member States to make further efforts to complete the harmonisation process .

Conclusion on injury Some injury indicators developed positively during the period considered , such as sales prices ( + 14 % ) , production capacity ( + 6 % ) and investments ( + 35 % ) . However , other injury indicators such as production ( - 3 % ) , capacity utilisation ( - 9 % ) , market share ( - 6 % ) and productivity ( - 5 % ) deteriorated , while sales on the Community market to unrelated customers stagnated despite increasing consumption during the period considered .
R282	In addition , there was a serious impact on the injury indicators related to the financial performance of the Community industry , such as cash flow ( - 47 % ) , return on investment ( - 32 % ) and profitability ( - 7,5 percentage points ) . This means that the ability of the Community industry to raise capital was also undermined . Furthermore , the investigation showed that the production costs of the Community industry increased significantly over the period considered , mainly due to the sharp increase in scrap prices ( + 34 % ) , which is the main raw material for the production of wire rod . However , given the price undercutting practiced by the Chinese and Moldovan exporters during the IP , the Community industry could not respond to the increased raw material prices in line with the increase in sales prices . It is clear from the above that , although the Community industry remained profitable during the IP by orientation to higher market segments with higher prices , its financial situation deteriorated significantly . On the basis of the above , it is concluded that the Community industry has suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 3(5 ) of the basic Regulation . Crews . Come in .

R304	With the development of scientific methods , the 19th century also started to develop brewing technology in agricultural schools , universities , as well as private research institutes and vocational training institutes . It is also worth mentioning the beginnings of the publication of technical publications on brewing , which were located in Munich . From this time on , Munich can be referred to as the ' Cerevisial - Universitätsstadt' . Today , the brewing faculty of München - Weihenstephan and the Doemens Institute of Doemens are the leading educational institutions for brewing and brewing technicians , who then work around the world . As shown above , the awareness of ' Münchner Bier' in Germany and the European Union has grown steadily over the last 550 years , as has its reputation . This is evidenced by the growing exports in the last 30 years , in particular the known ' Oktoberfestbier' , which can only be referred to by Munich breweries . ' Münchner Bier' , a beer festival known as ' Oktoberfest' , is known throughout the world . In the context of a sports sponsorship such as the German National Beamer Team or in the Olympic Hall , the name ' Münchner Bier' has been carried by television cameras throughout the world . In recent decades , radio , television and , in particular , the internet have deserved that ' Münchner Bier' knows more and more people around the world .

" Honor Harrington did n't . it had become one of them , and yet , whether she knew it or not , it was also the patron saint of their fleet . She probably did n't know , White Haven told himself . It would not have occurred to her . . . which would undoubtedly explain . But White Haven and any other Manticoran working for the GSN certainly knew that . It was impossible not to know .
R306	The touchstone of every Grayson concept of training or tactical innovation could be expressed in three words : " Lady Harrington says ' or an additional expression , Lady Harrington would have done . " This almost a cult of personality , with which the GSN had adopted the principles and the example of a single , capable individual , would be terrifying when it was not the need to constantly reconsider the ideas of the individual . Honor Harrington somehow - and White Haven was n't sure how - had managed to imprint that part of his personality so enthusiastically , and he was not happy with it . The GSN , of course , had given her a much freer hand than the Manticoran Admiralty had ever given any RMN admiral , but the results did not take effect on the effect . Admiral Matthews had explicitly admitted to White Haven that he had literally forced her to join the GSN service to take advantage of her brain , and the Count could understand that at once . Few fleets with experience could match the Royal Manticoran Navy , and in spite of the political problems of Harrington at home , her professional reputation in the navy of the native kingdom had no equal . Any Navy in the GSN 's position would do virtually anything to get her in her uniform , even if he did n't experience it in action . That 's all .

This disapproval should not , however , become an excuse to act . 6.4 Communication and awareness - raising In order to effectively address the issue of ID , the public must be informed and involved in this process . Currently , only 2 % of European citizens consider biological invasion as an important threat to biodiversity . communication and outreach activities should create a sense of responsibility among European citizens , institutions and sectors with regard to trade in and dissemination of potential invasive species . If such communication and outreach activities are not limited to the threat to biodiversity , but also highlight other dangers - public health threats , agriculture - citizens will be less reluctant to adopt new legislation and the creation of a new European agency , especially if it is clear that inaction is much more costly in the long term than when measures are implemented now . The sooner the appropriate measures are implemented , the lower the total costs . 6.5 Social aspects The EESC proposes that the Commission should examine all existing instruments and legislation to address the issue of invasive species and their harmful social effects . to ensure decontamination of containers in different ways .

R326	190 In the third complaint , the Commission submits that the method of calculating the financial correction based on the value of planting rights is appropriate since the lump sum intended to compensate for losses incurred by the funds can be deduced from the value of planting rights used for the calculation of the regularisation fee . It also points out that , in the light of the non - knowledge of the amount of aid to be granted in the future , it could not rely on its established practice in the field of flat - rate financial corrections and could be based only on the value of planting rights .

The questions referred for a preliminary ruling 24 By its two questions , the Consiglio di Stato asks , in essence , whether Article 11 of Directive 97/13 precludes national legislation , such as the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings , which requires a company which holds an individual licence to provide a public telecommunications network for which it has paid a charge such as that referred to in that article to pay an additional charge for the private use of that network .
R330	27 In addition , Article 7(2 ) of that directive authorises Member States to establish a system of individual licences for the introduction and operation of public telecommunications networks and other networks involving the use of radio frequencies . 28 It follows that that directive applies , in principle , not only to public telecommunications networks and services , but also to private telecommunications networks which have not been made available to the public and are reserved to a limited range of users and to services provided in those private networks . 29 However , according to the referring court , the network at issue in the main proceedings was made available to the public on the basis of an individual licence authorising NST to provide the public telecommunications network in accordance with Article 7(2 ) of Directive 97/13 . M_2005255EN.01014901.xml EN Official Journal of the European Union L 255/149 DIRECTIVE 2005/41/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 7 September 2005 amending Council Directive 76/115/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to anchorages for motor vehicles ( Text with EEA relevance ) Regulation ( EC )
R331	Research has shown that in the event of an accident , the use of safety belts and restraint systems can contribute significantly to a significant reduction in the number of fatalities and the severity of injury , even if the vehicle is overturned . The installation of safety belts and restraint systems in all categories of vehicles will no doubt constitute an important step forward in improving road safety and the consequent saving of lives . Fitting all vehicles with safety belts could be of considerable benefit to society . In its Resolution of 18 February 1986 on common measures to reduce road accidents under the Community road safety programme ( 3 ) , the European Parliament stressed the need to make the use of safety belts compulsory for all passengers , including children , except in public service vehicles . As a result , a distinction has to be made between public service buses and other vehicles as regards the compulsory installation of safety belts or restraint systems . Therefore , only these vehicles must be equipped with anchorages intended for safety belts or restraint systems which meet the requirements of Directive 76/115/EEC ( 5 ) . Directive 76/115/EEC already provides for all technical and administrative provisions for the approval of vehicles of categories other than M 1 .
R332	Since the entry into force of Commission Directive 96/38/EC of 17 June 1996 adapting to technical progress Council Directive 76/115/EEC concerning anchorages of safety belts of motor vehicles , several Member States have laid down mandatory compliance with that Directive for certain categories of vehicles other than M 1 . to this end , manufacturers and their suppliers have developed the appropriate technology . Directive 76/115/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly . Since the objectives of this Directive , namely the improvement of road safety by the introduction of the compulsory fitting of certain categories of vehicles safety bands can not be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore , by reason of the scale of the measures proposed in this field , be better achieved at Community level , the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty .

R333	The deposit with the Treasury can not be regarded as a genuine short - term contribution without risks on the basis of PI 's constant obligation to pay cash to the State Treasury . the declared yield reflected this long - term obligation because it paid the long - term implicit risk of the Italian Republic , an estimate of an extraordinary return of 0,30 % ( equal to the market margin paid on long - term government securities compared to the cash parameters ) . The impossibility of PI to adopt active liquidity management strategies ( quantitative analysis [ ... ] is aimed at quantifying these burdens ) . ( ii ) The costs associated with the contributions of PI 's retail customers are the costs associated with deposits in the private sector for banks in the private sector , as the Commission itself has acknowledged . On the contrary , the interest margin achieved by the private sector banks in the case of a part of deposits on its own network is significantly higher than the interest margin of PI ( 4,7 % in 2006 and 4,6 % in 2005 compared to 3,75 % and 3 % for PI ) . According to [ ... ] , these data constitute evidence of the absence of State aid in favour of PI . the sword was no match for long battles .

The aim of the present Commission proposal is to amend Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 3922/91 on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation [ 1 ] to bring it into line with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[2 ] , as last amended by Council Decision 2006/512/EC of 17 July 2006[3 ] . - Background Decision 2006/512/EC introduced a new type of procedure for the exercise of implementing powers , the regulatory procedure with scrutiny .
R366	This new regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be used , in particular , where necessary , to repeal , amend or replace the annexes to the basic instrument , or to adapt it to scientific and technical progress . On the contrary , the normal regulatory procedure will remain in force in the case of an exemption from the application of the provisions of the basic act or of one of its annexes to the Member States by the Commission . - Content Article 8(1 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) and Article 11 of Regulation ( EC ) No 3922/91 allow the Commission to repeal , amend or replace common standards set out in Annex III through the regulatory procedure . Decision 2006/512/EC also provides that where , on imperative grounds of urgency , the normal time - limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny can not be complied with , the Commission could use the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6 ) of that Decision . This particular urgency procedure , which allows , in particular , the immediate adoption of measures in accordance with the opinion of the committee responsible , is particularly necessary for the adoption of certain measures in the event of the maintenance of a sufficient level of aviation safety . Therefore , this procedure is designed as an alternative to the last subparagraph of Article 8(1 ) and Article 11(1 ) .

R385	The transaction date is the date on which the transaction is qualified for the first time in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards . For practical reasons , a rate that approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction is often used ; for example , the average rate of a week or a month may be used for all transactions in each foreign currency that took place in that period . However , if the exchange rate fluctuates significantly , the use of the average rate for the period is inappropriate . ( a ) monetary items denominated in foreign currency must be converted using the closing rates ; The carrying amount of any item is determined in accordance with other relevant standards . For example , property , plant and equipment may be measured at fair value or cost in accordance with IAS 16 Property , Plant and Equipment . Whether the carrying amount is based on a fair value or a historical cost , the amounts of the items in foreign currency so determined are transferred to the functional currency in accordance with this Standard . The carrying amount of some items is determined by comparing two or more amounts .
R386	If the asset is non - monetary and measured in a foreign currency , the carrying amount is determined by comparing the following values : ( a ) the cost or book value determined by the exchange rate prevailing on the date the amount was determined ( i.e. the exchange rate at the date of the transaction for the item measured on the basis of historical cost ) ; and ( b ) net realisable amount or recoverable amount determined on the date the value was determined ( i.e. the exchange rate at the date of the balance sheet ) . The effect of this comparison may result in the observed impairment loss in the functional currency not being measured in a foreign currency and vice versa . If several exchange rates are available , the exchange rate shall be used at which the future cash flow represented by the transaction or balance would be settled if such cash flow were incurred at the measurement date . If the convertibility of the two currencies is temporarily lacking , the first exchange rate shall be used with which the conversion could be carried out . " It 's nothing but some kind of crystal .

This view is shared by many Europeans , but the EU , when considering the entry into the skirmish of peace talks in the Middle East , must react with the mocking remark of former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon that " you are the payers , but not actors " in the region . yet the potential of Europe should not be underestimated .
R428	Between 1995 and 1999 , Europe spent around € 3.4 billion in the region , to which the European Investment Bank added an additional € 4.8 billion . Between 2000 and 2006 , Europe spent an additional € 5.35 billion and the EIB granted € 6.4 billion of loans . This year the European Commission has committed € 320 million to Palestine itself . The Palestinian Authority has adopted more aid per capita than the post - war Europe within the Marshall Plan , and yet the Israeli - Palestinian conflict policy undermines the hope of a broader Euro - Mediterranean framework that could outline dialogue and investment policy promising real improvements in millions of lives . It is clear that peace in the Middle East is not born from individual projects . it will evolve more from a concept that will cope with existential needs . The core of the future of dialogue and investment must be a stability charter to address the concerns of people about land , economy , demography and transnational cooperation . To capture peace , long - term regional interests must prevail over national programs . it is this multi - lateral ethos that Europe must enforce . Thank you .

There is no need to comply with the Council 's request to maintain the temporal effects of the contested measures . Orders the Council of the European Union to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by A. 53 The conflicting marks consist of the prefix ' uni' , which is closely accompanied by terms which are descriptive or not distinctive in relation to the services in question . In response to a question from the Court , the applicant and the intervener stated that the element ' rak' in the earlier mark UNIRAK consists of the initial letters of the German words Renten , Aktien , ( ' bonds , shares ' ) or Renten , Aktien , Kapital ( ' bonds , shares , capital' ) , thus referring to the investment objectives and policy of the fund designated by that mark . Moreover , as the applicant pointed out in the administrative procedure , without the intervener disputing those assertions , the words ' fonds ' and ' zinss' , attached to the prefix ' uni' in the earlier marks UNIFONDS and UNIZINS , constitute investment ' funds' and ' interest' .
R498	As regards the UniCredit Wealth Management trade mark , it should be pointed out , first , that the word directly attached to the prefix ' uni' refers to a normal operation in the financial sector which the bank gives to its client a sum of money . The fact that the words ' credit' and ' management' belong to the English language does not make it possible to exclude the possibility that the relevant public attributes some importance to them in relation to the services in question . The words ' credit' and ' management' are similar to the German words with the same meaning as ' Credit ' and ' Management' . The word " fonds " belongs to the German and not the English language , even if the applicant claims otherwise . Furthermore , the words ' wealth' and ' management' are commonly used in the financial sector , including in Germany , for financial services such as investment advice or accounting services , as the Board of Appeal rightly pointed out in paragraph 40 of the contested decision of 25 September 2006 . Finally , in connection with the word ' web' in the UNIWEB mark , the Opposition Division stated , without being contradicted by the applicant in that regard , that it was a common abbreviation of the English term ' world wide web' relating to the global computer network .

The resulting gap - between real and potential output - is estimated at more than 7 % of GDP ( over $ 1 trillion ) . This output gap reflects the deficit of more than 12 million jobs - the number of seats needed to return to the highest employment level of the economy in 2007 and the absorption of 125,000 people entering the workforce each month . While the economy will grow by 2.5 % in 2012 , as most forecasts expect , the employment deficit will remain - and will not close until 2024 . The US job deficit is primarily due to a lack of aggregate demand . consumption , which accounts for around 70 % of total expenditure , reduces high unemployment , weak wage increases , and a sharp decline in the value of houses and consumer property . The modest increase in consumption in the last months of 2011 was financed by a decrease in the household saving rate and a significant increase in consumer credit .

In the absence of specific rules at Union level , Member States may normally determine how services of general economic interest will be organised and financed . The purpose of this Communication is to explain the main concepts when applying the State aid rules to public service compensation ( 2 ) . This Communication shall be without prejudice to the application of other provisions of Union law , in particular public procurement provisions and requirements arising from the Treaty and from sectoral Union legislation . If a public authority decides to entrust the provision of services to a third party , it must comply with the requirements of Union law on public procurement stemming from Articles 49 to 56 of the Treaty , the European Public Procurement Directive ( Directive 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water , energy , transport and postal services sectors ( 6 ) and Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council 2004/18/EC of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts , public supply contracts and public service contracts ( 7 ) and sectoral rules ( 8 ) .

The Commission will respond to questions concerning the topics of this Communication , Decision 2012/21/EU and the Communication from the Commission on the EU Framework for State aid in the form of public service compensation ( 2011 ) , as well as individual questions that will arise from the application of the State aid rules to these services .

R583	' The synthesis of the mid - term evaluation has put some light on the current state of play in terms of self - assessment under Leader+ , revealing in particular serious gaps in coverage and quality of activities . There was a lack of coordination and a co - operation between the LAG and national networks , with some exceptions , only a minor role in terms of active support . Self - assessment is often limited to one - off activities without subsequent corrective steps . A study recommended the combination of external evaluation and assisted self - assessment at LAG level with greater support for regional and national networks . The development of tools is very necessary : some summaries or exemplary information about self - assessment have been prepared by national network units ( NLU ) , for example in Finland and Austria . The Finnish NSJ has issued two extensive documents of self - assessment which are available on fi - language .

His book uses a great deal of power , one that goes beyond anything you 've ever known . It gives the villains and heroes what they think it deserves . our collective frustration ? I guess it 's better than blaming bad judgment and gin . Welcome to Mr. Goose . ten minutes later he put his gear in a waterproof bag and set off for Radujeaku . In the suburbs , he picked up a taxi that drove him near the place Clarke had indicated to him . He paid the driver the money he had gotten at E - Branch , and with a backpack over his shoulder , he went down the trail to his destination . There was a wilderness all around , and completely deserted . at the pool he placed his knapsack in the thicket and covered it with shredded branches . Harry climbed to the edge of the pool at the base of the ivy - covered rock , where the damp layers of limestone glimmered . gray Carpathia loomed in the northeast , and a wooded landscape sloped south to the south . and others like him . now Harry had to determine the location of the Gate as accurately as possible before he could reach it upstream .

The Möbius door from which he had climbed were the same as usual : just a " hole " in space , no different from the hundreds of other doors Harry used . he moved again , this time closer to the peaks of the mountains . ... but when he came out this time , the edges of the door wavered slightly . I do n't doubt it . Fine . Thanks a lot . Will that be enough ? undoubtedly . Thanks , Seth . I 'll take your groceries , you want ? You 'd be good , young man . I 'll buy you some alcohol , will you ? You 'd be good . The rest of your life . And a nice little girl with Jules . Thanks . Do n't do it , boy . I 've never had a good shot .

( Article 28 ) The provisions on dependent proceedings constitute an important aspect of the coordination of jurisdiction in the States bound by the Convention .
R633	The new wording of Article 28(1 ) no longer requires , as was the case in a previous version , that dependent proceedings are heard at first instance . The reason for this requirement that ' otherwise the subject - matter of the proceedings would be different , and one of the parties could thus lose one degree in the judicial hierarchy ( 153 ) , it does not appear convincing . stay of proceedings by the court second seised has no effect on the proceedings before that court , which may be renewed as soon as the dependent proceedings before a foreign court have been concluded . This is the appropriate time at which it can be assessed whether a foreign judicial decision respects the rights of the defendant guaranteed by the Convention and whether it may be taken into account for the purposes of the proceedings before the court second seised . Otherwise , if the case before the court first seised were on appeal , one of the parties would have been deprived of one step in the judicial hierarchy . On the other hand , if , on the other hand , the case before the court seised is on appeal , it would not be appropriate , for reasons of economics of the proceedings , for that court to be declared not to have jurisdiction in favour of a fresh trial before the Court of First Instance .

R644	66 The fact that the Member States had to notify them of Regulation No 1177/2002 to notify the aid measures envisaged before the expiry of that regulation and before all the contracts fulfilling the requirements for the grant of aid were signed can not call into question the application of the principles governing the temporal application of substantive rules to the system of State aid control . It is inherent in the system prior to the review of State aid that the notification must necessarily contain estimates of the total amounts of aid envisaged . That is particularly the case with regard to a measure relating to operating aid such as the aid at issue in the present case . 67 In the light of the foregoing , and in the absence of transitional provisions extending the temporal scope of Regulation No 1177/2002 , the second plea must be rejected in its entirety .
R645	70 According to the Italian Republic , it is clear from the case - law that the Commission is always required , of its own motion , to examine the possible compatibility of aid under Article 87(2 ) and ( 3 ) EC , except where there are obvious elements which prevent any possible justification for the scheme at issue . The latter situation was not envisaged in the present case , since the notified measure consisted solely in refinancing an aid scheme which was already considered to be compatible with the common market and all other conditions remained unchanged . It also points out that the absence of aid could have the effect of closing the shipyards . However , the Commission did not provide any corresponding reply to its proposals in the contested decision . 72 In addition , the Italian Republic claims that the General Court itself should assess the notified measure and declare it compatible with the common market . 73 For the same reasons as those set out in paragraphs 68 to 71 above , the Italian Republic further submits that the reasons set out in recital 26 of the contested decision are inadequate , which , in its view , corresponds to an infringement of Article 253 EC . In that regard , it refers to the case - law according to which , in order for the Commission to comply with its obligation to state reasons , it must apply specific circumstances and not general ones .

Governments should , for example , help banks that lend to small and medium - sized enterprises that are the main source of job creation , where appropriate , to set up new financial institutions - and not to support large banks that make money on derivatives and unfair credit card practices . financial markets have worked diligently to create a system that promotes their interests : if capital markets are free and open , a small country can be flooded at one point in time , so that high interest rates will be charged shortly thereafter - or completely cut off from finance .

R658	The principle of proportionality , which is one of the general principles of Community law , requires that measures adopted by Community institutions do not exceed the limits of what is appropriate and necessary in order to attain the legitimate objectives pursued by the legislation in question , it being understood that , where there is a choice between several appropriate measures , the least restrictive measure must be chosen and the disadvantages caused must not be disproportionate to the objectives pursued . ( see paras 35 , 37 ) 2 . In the light of the principle of proportionality , the validity of a Community act does not depend on the retrospective assessment of its effectiveness . If the Community legislature is required to assess the future effects of the legislation to be taken , even if its effects can not be presumed to be precision , its assessment can be examined only where it appears to be manifestly incorrect in the light of the facts which it was aware of at the time of the adoption of the legislation in question .

" Strengthening the stability and prosperity of Latin America Brazil has strengthened relations with its neighbours in the past few years , in particular with Argentina in the new " strategic relationship " . Brazil , politically , has become a pillar of the stability of South America . within its political and institutional system , it has been able to respond to numerous challenges faced by many countries within the region ( such as social cohesion ) . Brazil is one of the main leaders of efforts to deepen South American integration through both Mercosur and the establishment of the South American community of states in December 2004 , leading to the creation of the UNASUR Union at the April 2007 regional summit . In recent years , Brazil 's relations with its neighbours have been more modest , as illustrated by the way in which she acts in areas where her opinions differ from those of Venezuela and Bolivia .
R691	In the areas of energy , telecommunications , transport and connectivity , Brazil plays an important role in promoting stability and prosperity in Latin America . The participation of Brazil in all major regional energy systems is a prerequisite for taking part in regional energy infrastructures . Its active participation and contribution to the debate on social cohesion and , in particular , in the next forum between the EU and Latin American States on social cohesion are highly assessed by the EU . - With the same effort , the EU will continue to cooperate with Brazil in implementing the recommendations adopted at the EU - Latin American Social Cohesion Conference in March 2006 and in achieving further progress in this agenda . preparing the forum between the EU and Latin America on social cohesion will be a good opportunity for dialogue . Both parties could also work together to support international organisations and civil society in promoting social cohesion .

The new energy policy therefore highlights the importance of establishing mechanisms to ensure solidarity between Member States and to diversify sources of supply and modes of transport . INDICATIVE EMISSIONS EMISSIONS Energy 80 % contributes to all greenhouse gas emissions in the EU . In its commitment to fight climate change , the EU has committed to reduce its internal emissions by at least 20 % by 2020 . Under this agreement , the EU sets as a new target the reduction of its own emissions by 30 % compared to 1990 . These targets are at the heart of the EU 's strategy for reducing global climate change . Reducing greenhouse gas emissions implies a reduction in energy consumption and the use of clean energy . Energy efficiency Reducing the overall primary energy consumption by 20 % by 2020 is the target set by the EU in the Energy Efficiency Action Plan ( 2007 - 2012 ) . In order to achieve this , concrete measures must be developed in particular regarding the energy economy in the transport sector , the development of minimum requirements for the efficiency of electrical appliances , the education and education of consumers on a rational and cost - effective approach , improving the efficiency of production , transmission and distribution of heat and electricity , the development of energy technologies and the energy efficiency of buildings .

R697	This claim could not be accepted . None of the citations from the report mentioned in the GOC 's comments on final disclosure contradicts the Commission 's assessment in recital ( 161 ) above .

That list includes proprlor . the effects of proprlor on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations ( EC ) No 451/2000 and ( EC ) No 1490/2002 for a range of uses proposed by the developer . Moreover , those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) in accordance with Article 8(1 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 451/2000 . for proprlor the rapporteur Member State was the Netherlands and all relevant information was submitted on 23 May 2007 . in accordance with Article 11a of Regulation ( EC ) No 1490/2002 .

National funds There are often national funds intended to support the extension of authorisations for minor uses and to finance the efficacy and presence of residues in relation to minor uses . The annual budget reserved by the Member States for this area is between EUR 40 000 and EUR 1 000 000 and consists of public , private or mixed funds , which does not include hidden contributions for staff and services .
R710	As part of a survey carried out by FCEC 15 Member States , the issue of minor uses is considered to be so significant that both structural and human resources are spent in order to address it . However , none of these states considers that the available resources are sufficient to address the problem at national level . In addition , 10 Member States do not have any resources . Other measures will aim at improving the business environment , removing regulatory and other barriers to investment and further strengthening the Single Market . Thanks to the fact that all the Partnership Agreements for the European Structural and Investment Funds for the period 2014 - 2020 are now approved and the remaining operational programmes are finalised , the investment should start in 2015 with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy 7 in terms of smart , sustainable and inclusive growth . In several Member States , the main source of public investment has become a new cohesion policy , which is firmly anchored in the European semester and the economic governance process . At a later stage of the Commission 's mandate , efforts to maximise the impact of the EU budget for employment , growth and investment and a renewed awareness of the need to improve public finances are reflected in the mid - term review of the MFF and in the preparation of the post-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework package .

Member States may provide that national regulatory authorities shall refuse to resolve a dispute through a binding decision where there are other mechanisms , including mediation , which would better contribute to resolving the dispute in a timely manner in accordance with Article 8 . The national regulatory authority shall inform the parties without delay . If the dispute is not resolved within four months and if it has not been brought before the court by the party seeking redress , the national regulatory authority shall , at the request of either Party , issue a binding decision with a view to resolving the dispute in the shortest possible time and in any event within four months .

In one case , however , the Commission did not quantify the objectives in question , in another , the deadlines for their fulfilment were up to the date of completion of the project , but at that date the balance of the grant would have been paid . In the calculation of water needs , the effect of the required reduction in water loss was not taken into account in any case .

However , where the Registrar has not asked the applicant to remedy the defects in the application or to produce the missing documents , it must be held that no provision of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of First Instance precludes the Civil Service Tribunal from taking measures of organisation of procedure in order to obtain the evidence in question . Furthermore , it is not apparent from Article 44(6 ) of those Rules that the action must be declared inadmissible only on the ground of failure to comply with the conditions laid down in Article 44(4 ) of the Rules of Procedure , where the applicant has not been asked to supplement the application .

R719	56 The fact that the term ' bioethanol' does not appear in the wording of that CN heading is irrelevant in that regard . To ensure legal certainty and facilitate checks , the decisive criterion for the tariff classification of goods must be sought in general by its objective characteristics and characteristics , as defined by the wording of the CN heading and the section or chapter notes ( see , inter alia , Case C - 142/06 Olicom [ 2007 ] ECR I - 6675 , paragraph 16 and the case - law cited ) . s ( a ) a product such as the one concerned by the main proceedings , even if it exhibits certain particularities relating , inter alia , to its production method , but , having regard to its objective characteristics and characteristics , remains ethyl alcohol with an alcoholic strength by volume exceeding 80 % vol . 57 The fact that such a product is not suitable for human consumption is also irrelevant as regards its classification under heading 2207 of the CN . As is clear from the very title of Directive 92/83 , the aim of that directive is to harmonise the structures of excise duties on both alcoholic beverages and alcohol in general ( Case C - 163/09 Repertoire Culinaire [ 2010 ] ECR I-12717 , paragraphs 27 and 29 ) . The Court found weaknesses in the objectives and indicators as major issues ( see paragraphs 10.9 to 10.16 ) .
R720	The Commission considers that it has made significant progress in providing information on the achievement of policy objectives in recent years , and that in particular the Annual Activity Reports of the Directorates - General contain a large number of useful information on policy objectives , achievements and their impact on society . The indicators presented generally provide useful information both on progress towards the achievement of general objectives within the various Commission policies and on the monitoring of performance . The Article 318 evaluation report continues to develop and is not yet suitable for its intended purpose in the discharge procedure . The Court takes note of the Commission 's commitment to strengthen a performance culture in the Commission and establish a reliable and stable system of performance management and performance information . The Commission recognises that the report continues to be part of the ongoing process and focuses annually on possible improvements for each subsequent year . As in previous years , the Court , as part of its work on performance audits , the results of which were published in the 2012 Special Reports , revealed shortcomings related to the entire typical management cycle .

On preliminary examination , the Commission finds that the notified transaction could fall within the scope of the EC Merger Regulation . Pursuant to the Commission Notice on a simplified procedure for treatment of certain concentrations under the EC Merger Regulation ( 2 ) it should be noted that this case is a candidate for treatment under the procedure set out in the Notice . The Commission invites interested third parties to submit their possible observations on the proposed operation to the Commission .

[ 14 ] The customer company was selected on the basis of an AJOFM market survey aimed at finding suitable companies interested in investing in Câmpia Turzii and taking part in the creation of a cooperative . [ 15 ] According to the Romanian authorities , the amount of EUR 15 000 per target worker was calculated in such a way that the estimated cost of production activity was disinherited by the expected number of workers needed . between each member of the cooperative and the AJOFM Cluj , a contract for the award of a voucher will be concluded specifying that the redundant persons must comply with the plan for the establishment and management of the cooperative .
R725	[ 17 ] Working capital designates the amount necessary to cover the costs incurred during several months of the cooperative 's operation , starting from the time the cooperative decides on the test operation and production , ending on the return of the value of the first products delivered . [ 18 ] Some of the former employees of Mechel with relevant experiences could also appoint vocational guidance but perform leadership or brokering functions ( HR , accounting , engineering , supervision of production , sales etc . ) . The rights and conditions relating to persons who enter or leave the cooperative will be determined by the management of the cooperative and indirectly by each of the members of the cooperative by means of voting rights at the General Assembly . [ 19 ] The AJOFM Cluj will conclude a contract with the cooperative , including provisions on the establishment , operation and sustainability of the cooperative , as well as provisions in case the obligations under the contract are not respected . A similar contract will be concluded between the AJOFM Cluj and the companies offering the unemployed . [ 20 ] This amount was established on the basis of estimates submitted by potential employers and traineeships providers , taking into account the need to cover the costs associated with the participation of targeted workers on traineeships .

R732	If the buyer pays the goods with a payment card , it will go directly to two transactions , that is to say , first , the sale of those goods by the supplier , which will also offset the VAT paid by the purchaser as the final consumer , collected by that supplier on behalf of the public Treasury , and , second , the supply of services to that supplier by the body which issued the card . In that regard , the Sixth Directive and Directive 2006/112 do not require that , for the purposes of the supply of goods or services ' in return for payment' , the consideration for that supply of goods or services should be obtained directly from the recipient . until then , the competent authority - the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate ( NVE ) - has taken over an entirely new administrative structure for the newly created administration of Enova . The Office commits an agreement with the Ministry to manage the Energy Fund in order to achieve the energy objectives newly defined by the Parliament and to manage the Fund in accordance with newly adopted legislation . Enova has been further invited to enforce competition in the market through the administration of the funds . This shows that Enova does not merely continue the work of the NVE , but is entrusted with new tasks and obligations , which is a fundamental change to the previous schemes .
R733	The fund may use this money for various types of support measures which are not limited to information activities ( 57 ) . In view of the above , the Authority concludes that the changes to the financing system are of a fundamental nature . The changes described change the aid scheme as such and do not constitute a severable part of existing schemes ( 58 ) . Both the new financing and management mechanism , as well as the obligation of Enova to achieve the newly defined energy objectives , affect the very structure of the support programme and apply to all measures receiving support under the Energy Fund . These changes were made in order to make better use of public resources and to achieve more sustainable energy efficiency outcomes , which required new structures to be implemented and new targets to be set .

The Centre 's main tasks are to collect and disseminate information on the prevention and control of human diseases and to provide scientific opinions in this field . is also intended to coordinate the European network of bodies active in this field ( 2 ) . Information from SUPPORT OF THE STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE The audit approach taken by the Court comprises analytical audit procedures , direct testing of transactions and an assessment of key controls of the Centre 's supervisory and control systems . This is supplemented by evidence provided by the work of other auditors ( where relevant ) and an analysis of management representations .
R744	Pursuant to the provisions of Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , the Court has audented the annual accounts ( 3 ) of the Centre , which comprise the financial statements ( 4 ) and the ' reports on implementation of the budget' ( 5 ) for the financial year ended 31 December 2011 and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying those accounts . The auditor 's responsibility The Court is required , on the basis of its audit , to provide the European Parliament and the Council ( 9 ) with a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the annual accounts of the Centre and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying them . These standards require the Court to plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the annual accounts of the Centre are free from material misstatement and the transactions underlying them are legal and regular . Audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the accounts and the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying them . In assessing those risks , the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the accounts , and supervisory and control systems implemented to ensure legality and regularity of underlying transactions , in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances .
R745	The audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made , as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the accounts . It follows from these rules that a lawyer must not run a business jointly with persons from other professions , such as accountants for example . a ban on multi - disciplinary partnerships was considered and accepted by the European Court of Justice in the Nova case .

R775	The Committee of the Regions ' reasoning strongly disagrees with the Commission 's proposal to lay down criteria for granting derogations based on local conditions through comitology ( Article 16(3 ) ) . Given the wide range of local and regional conditions , it is very difficult , if not impossible , to establish uniform criteria at EU level . The exemption procedure contains sufficient safeguards against abuse , since the licensing authorities can grant an exemption only on the basis of an impact assessment ( Article 16(3 ) ) and are obliged to make the relevant reasons available to the public ( Article 26(3)(f ) ) .

Hello ? ... in good condition , but now we only have two operational machines . graphs 5.1 and 5.2 illustrate the specification of expenditure committed and reimbursed in 2003 . The majority of expenditure is targeted at three priority policy objectives : Objective 2 : support for areas facing restructuring ; Community initiatives amounted to just over 5 % of Structural Measures expenditure in 2003 . These are programmes which , at the initiative of the Commission in the Community interest , are implemented by the Member States on their territory and complement actions carried out under the main programmes . Support for Structural Funds is in the form of ' operational programmes' , consisting of a large number of transactions or projects , while the support of the Cohesion Fund comes in the form of contributions to individual projects ( 3 ) . Each programme or project must be approved by the Commission and supported by an indicative financial plan specifying the amount of Community assistance and the Member State 's contribution . for the 1994 to 1999 period , the European Commission approved 1 104 Structural Funds programmes and 920 Cohesion Fund projects .
R777	Between 1994 and 1999 , and in previous programming periods , contributions for structural measures were paid in the form of advances and final payments , with final payments constituting ' closure' of programmes or projects . For the programming period 2000 to 2006 , the Community financing has the form of a single initial advance payment of 7 % of the total contribution to the programme or project , followed by the periodic reimbursement of expenditure declared by the Member States and final payments . These reimbursements are called ' interim payments' . Each payment from the Structural Funds concerns the Fund and the programme . Structural measures are guided by the principle of ' shared management' . The budgetary commitments already made for the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument ( ENPI ) appropriations on cross - border cooperation under heading 1B of the financial framework ( Interinstitutional Agreement 2006/C 139/01 ) will remain available for their normal period of validity , but may only be used for activities carried out exclusively in the Member States concerned . if they are found in the implementation and/or reference sources None Amendment A1:1996 to EN 60601 - 2 - 19:1996 ( IEC 60601 - 2 - 19:1990/A1:1996 )

Member States shall ensure that the authorised amounts expressed in terms of benefits and the number of applications are the minimum necessary to achieve the desired effect , even if higher quantities do not result in unacceptable risks to human or animal health or to the environment . The authorised amounts must vary according to the agricultural , plant health and environmental ( including climatic ) conditions in the various areas for which the authorisation is granted and must be proportionate to them .

In dogs , infections were generally associated with immunosuppression . In dogs , undesirable decreases in blood pressure were observed and heart rate increased and an undesirable decrease of minute volume was observed in the rat respiratory study . Border dose ( based on free - dose Cmax ) in dogs and rats was 15.7-fold and 10.4-fold higher than the maximum recommended human dose ( 25 mg twice daily ) . Ruxolitinib decreased foetal weight and increased post - implantation loss in animal studies . There was no evidence of teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits . However , the border exposures compared to the highest clinical dose were low and the results are therefore of limited relevance to humans . No effect on fertility was observed . In pups , decreased mean birth weights and short periods of decreased mean weight gain were observed . In lactating rats ruxolitinib and/or its metabolites were excreted in milk at concentrations 13-fold higher than in maternal plasma . Ruxolitinib was not mutagenic and clastogenic .

However , since Article 23(1 ) of Regulation No 4253/88 imposes an obligation on the Member States to recover funds lost as a result of abuse or negligence , the fact that a Member State has already repaid the relevant Community amounts does not in itself relieve the obligation to recover those funds . 58 Consequently , it follows from the foregoing considerations that the answer to the questions referred must be that the recovery of funds lost as a result of an abuse or negligence must be carried out on the basis of Article 23(1 ) of Regulation No 4253/88 and in accordance with the rules of national law , subject to the proviso that the application of that right must not prevent the application and effectiveness of Community law and effectively prevent the recovery of sums unlawfully granted .
R792	The national court must ensure that Community law is fully applied by not applying or interpreting , as necessary , a national rule such as Awb to prevent recovery .

If the change during this period in more than half of the reference filters is greater than ± 5 μg , the sample filter weighing can be considered valid . If at the end of this time two reference filters have been used and one filter is greater than ± 5 μg , the sampling filter weighing may be considered valid provided that the sum of the absolute differences between the measuring values and the rolling averages of the two reference filters is not more than 10 μg . If less than half of the reference filters meet the ± 5 μg criterion , the sampling filter shall be discarded and the emissions test repeated . For all other cases , the reference filters shall be replaced at least once every 30 days in such a way that no sampling filter is considered without comparison with a reference filter which was at least one day in weighing room .

R828	THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION , Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , and in particular Articles 121(2 ) and 148(4 ) thereof , Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies ( 1 ) , and in particular Article 5(2 ) thereof , Whereas : On the recommendation of the European Commission , Having regard to the European Parliament resolution , Having regard to the conclusions of the European Council , Having regard to the opinion of the Employment Committee , Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee , Having regard to the opinion of the Social Protection Committee , Having regard to the opinion of the Economic Policy Committee , Whereas : On 26 March 2010 , the European Council agreed to the Commission 's proposal to launch a new strategy for growth and jobs , Europe 2020 , based on enhanced coordination of economic policies . The strategy focuses on the key areas where action is needed to boost Europe 's potential for sustainable growth and competitiveness .
R829	These initiatives presented under the Pact are in line with the National Reform Programme and with the Federal Framework Law on Budget and the Stability Programme . While the related measures address some of the main socio - economic problems of the country , there are other problems that would be useful in commitments including fiscal policy , education , competition and innovation problems . The commitments made under the Euro Plus Pact have been assessed and have been taken into account in the implementation of the recommendations . The Commission has assessed the Stability Programme and the National Reform Programme of Austria , as well as the commitments made by that country under the Euro Plus Pact . taking into account not only their relevance for sustainable fiscal and socio - economic policy in Austria , but also their compliance with EU rules and guidance , given the need to reinforce the overall economic governance of the EU by providing EU - level input into future national decisions . The Committee considers that , in view of the favourable economic conditions , fiscal consolidation efforts should be strengthened in particular in 2012 and that the reform of fiscal relations between the different levels of government should continue . Reducing tax burdens , improving educational outcomes and combating gender segmentation would benefit from labour market dynamics , while enhancing competition and fostering innovation would contribute to competitiveness .
R830	To this end , adopt and implement the necessary measures , including measures at levels below the national level . Specify the measures necessary to ensure adequate progress towards the achievement of the medium - term objective of the Stability and Growth Pact once the excessive deficit has been corrected . In consultation with the social partners and in accordance with national practices , take measures to further restrict access to the current early retirement system for persons with long insurance periods and take measures to reduce the transitional period for the harmonisation of the statutory retirement age for women and men so as to ensure the sustainability and adequacy of the pension system . strictly apply the conditions for obtaining an invalidity pension .

Although the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations is one of the fundamental principles of the Community , economic operators have no reason to have a legitimate expectation that an existing situation , which may be altered in the context of the Community institutions ' discretion , in particular in an area such as the common organisation of the markets , the subject - matter of which involves permanent adaptation by reference to changes in the economic situation . Thus , the economic circles concerned by the imports of bananas concerned in the Community can not have any hope of maintaining the applicable legislation , since that legislation has not only acknowledged many changes over time , in particular on account of international commitments entered into by the Community in the context of the World Trade Organisation , but also requires constant adaptation in the light of changes in the economic situation , which leaves a broad discretion to the Community institutions .

R835	It considered that , in the light of the case - law of the Court of Justice , in particular Case C-262/88 Barber [ 1990 ] ECR I-1889 , the system in question must be regarded as contrary to the principle of equal treatment laid down in Article 141 EC , in so far as it provides for different conditions of age for the grant of a bridging allowance for men and women . According to that case - law , since Article 141 EC is binding and directly applicable , the different age conditions are invalid and the entitlement to the bridging allowance must belong to men and women who have reached the age of 50 at the time of the termination of the employment relationship and are not yet entitled to a pension under the ASVG .

Gentlemen , Mrs. Wilhelmina Harker . aid to encourage the production of quality agricultural products : The aid will be granted up to 70 % of the costs incurred ; the aid must be granted in the form of subsidised services and must not involve direct payments of money to producers . 36 Furthermore , neither Article 34(2 ) EU nor any other provision of Title VI of the EU Treaty distinguishes between types of acts which may be adopted on the basis of the subject - matter of the common procedure for cooperation in criminal matters . 37 Thus , Article 34(2 ) EU does not introduce the order of priority between the various instruments listed in that provision , so that it is not excluded that the Council may choose between several instruments for adapting the same area , subject to the limits laid down by the nature of the instrument chosen . In order to determine the volume of actual production , the institutions relied on information according to which the applicant operated at 80 % of its full nominal capacity . According to the Council , this rate was also applied to producers which did not cooperate .
R841	The facts relied on by the applicant concerning hurricanes suffered by the States of Louisiana and Texas during the RIP were not provided in the course of the administrative procedure . Thus , the applicant can not rely on those facts for the purpose of finding a manifest error of assessment made by the institutions . In any event , recital 26 in the preamble to the contested regulation shows that the institutions took into account the effects of hurricanes affecting the countries of Louisiana and Texas during the RIP . The applicant did not dispute that point . 51 The economic report referred to by the applicant in its written pleadings and referred to in recital 26 in the preamble to the contested regulation confirms any unused production capacity in the United States . This report shows , in particular , that there is an oversupply on the US market . Finally , the Council points out that the assertion made in recital 117 of the contested regulation is in fact justified by the fact that , instead of five years , the maintenance of the anti - dumping measures is ' confined' for a period of two years . 53 In the first place , it should be noted that recital 26 in the preamble to the contested regulation shows a discrepancy in the relevant facts taken into account for the purpose of determining the unused production capacity in the United States .

In the view of the Commission , Germany has sufficiently demonstrated that the BdB 's claim is irrelevant . BdB argues that the silent partnership contribution of the Land of Hessen constitutes an abuse of the form of a ' normal' silent partnership contribution . but there are no key points . The Commission further interprets the " Sydney Declaration " of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision of October 1998 , so that , as core capital , it only imposes a limit of 15 % for the recognition of certain , in particular time - limited , innovative capital instruments . However , it does not follow that permanent innovative capital instruments can not be recognised as core capital at all or that they will also fall below that threshold .
R868	From a risk analysis point of view , the silent partnership contribution of the Land of Hessen can be compared with a ' normal' silent partnership contribution rather than with share capital . To this extent , the Panel is also in line with the comments made by Germany . In this respect , it is essential for the Commission that both the silent partnership contribution of the Land of Hessen , as well as the other ' normal' silent partnership contributions adopted on the market , that is to say , time - limited silent partnership contributions , must be repaid before share capital and the investor will thus be compensated , whereas in the case of the share capital investment the investor will become idle .

In view of the above , it is likely that the imposition of measures may lead to an increase in the Union prices of the product under investigation and may thus lead to a decrease in the number of installations of photovoltaic installations in the short term . First , the PV - related activity in at least some of the installers represents only some of their business activities and is also seasonal . As the renewable and energy efficiency targets set at Union level are legally binding on the Member States , it is to be expected that the reduced demand for solar installations will lead to an increase in demand for other forms of renewable electricity and energy efficiency . Many employees in the downstream sector are likely to have the necessary skills to benefit from the increase in demand in these close sectors .

R884	outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 continue to occur in poultry and wild birds , and due to close contact between humans with infected birds , the disease is continued in third countries , sometimes with fatal consequences . Consequently , the risk that the disease may spread from third countries to the Member States persists . It is therefore appropriate to maintain biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 from wild birds to poultry and other captive birds and to preserve early detection systems in particularly vulnerable zones , in addition to limiting the direct risk arising from imports of poultry , poultry products and pet birds . The measures provided for in Decisions 2005/692/EC , 2005/731/EC , 2005/734/EC and 2007/25/EC should therefore be maintained in order to reduce the risk of transmission of that disease . The period of application of those Decisions should therefore be prolonged until 31 December 2010 . Decisions 2005/692/EC , 2005/731/EC , 2005/734/EC and 2007/25/EC should therefore be amended accordingly . the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health , HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION : Article 1 In Article 7 of Decision 2005/692/EC , the date ' 31 December 2009' is replaced by ' 31 December 2010' .

In vivo , a quantitative correlation between the uptake of florbetaben ( 18F ) in the grey matter of the cerebral cortex and the β-amyloid depositories in the autopsy samples has not been evaluated in end - life patients . The binding of florbetaben ( 18F ) in vivo to other amyloid structures or other brain structures or receptors remains unknown . Pharmacodynamic effects At low chemical concentrations present with Neuraceq , florbetaben ( 18F ) does not have any identifiable pharmacodynamic activity . For completed clinical studies , the uptake of florbetaben ( 18F ) in 7 pre - defined cortical regions of the brain ( frontal , parietal , lateral and media temporal , and occipital , caudate and back cingular / precuneous cortex and the frontal cingular gyrus ) and the cerebral cortex were measured quantitatively by standardised reuptake values ( SUV ) .

Okay , and remember ... impact of changes in consumption and consumer preferences and impact of changes in the structure of the retail sector in the Union It was also claimed that the lack of performance of the Union industry should not be associated with imports from the countries concerned but rather with a decrease in consumption in the Union . This decrease in consumption is allegedly linked to changes in fashion trends , which meant the transition from formal footwear to more informal footwear . The consumer prevalence has therefore changed in favour of the low - priced segment typically represented by imports from third countries . If , however , there were complete substitutability between leather shoes and other materials , this decrease would be much more pronounced . As a result , the decrease in consumption and changes in consumer preferences are not in themselves a factor that would break the causal link . The investigation has also demonstrated that the retail sales of footwear have been diversified from traditional shoe shops to a number of new outlets , including stores , clothing shops and supermarkets or hypermarkets , which account for a significant amount of sales that may exceed 40 % .
R897	It was also claimed that strong competition exerts a downward pressure on prices and that this effect has a higher impact on the Union industry than the dumped imports . Although the pressure of the retail sector can not , as such , be excluded as a factor that may have an impact on the Union industry , it should be borne in mind that this structure also depends on finding suppliers that are able to supply products at appropriately low prices . As a result , large volumes of dumped products were the main factor in developing and maintaining this price pressure . Given the fact that the Union producers managed to increase their prices , this also indicates that the impact of changes in the retail structure is not such as to break the causal link between the injury and the dumped imports .

Article 6 - Conditions for fishing 1 . The holding of fishing activities by Community vessels shall be subject to the holding of a licence issued by the competent authorities of Mauritania at the request of the competent Community authorities . rules on the issue of licences and the payment of fees and contributions to scientific observation costs , as well as other conditions for the pursuit of fisheries by Community vessels in Mauritanian fishing zones , are set out in the Annexes . Conclusion on causation It is clear from the above analysis that there was a substantial increase in volume and market share of the dumped imports from Russia during the period considered and at the same time , export prices decreased over the same period . This increase in market share coincided with a significant decrease in the market share of the Union industry . The price pressure of imports on the Union market did not allow the Union industry to increase its sales prices to a profitable level despite the decrease in its unit cost of production , which resulted in losses of the Union industry .
R912	Examination of these other factors showed that , in particular , imports from Turkey and China could have contributed to the injury suffered by the Union industry . However , when taking into account the higher prices and the lower import volumes from Turkey compared to the imports from Russia as well as the low level of imports from China , it was concluded that these factors could not break the causal link between the dumped imports from Russia and the injury suffered by the Union industry . On the basis of the above , the Commission concluded at this stage that the material injury suffered by the Union industry is due to the dumped imports from the country concerned and that other factors , individually or collectively , do not break this causal link . In particular , the injury consists mainly of financial losses and the loss of market share in the Union market .

R924	Regulation No 17 and Regulation No 1/2003 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty have a margin of discretion in fixing the amount of fines in order to direct the conduct of undertakings with a view to complying with the competition rules and to adjust the level of fines at any time to the needs of that policy . the Commission 's previous decision - making practice does not create a legal framework for setting fines in the field of competition . The decisions concerning other cases are merely indicative as regards the possible existence of discrimination , since it is unlikely that the circumstances of these other cases , such as the markets concerned , products , undertakings and periods , are the same . the Commission assesses the seriousness of the infringements by reference to a number of factors which are not summarised in a binding or exhaustive list of criteria to be taken into account . In addition , it is not obliged to apply a precise mathematical formula , be it the total amount of the fine imposed or the division into different elements . Under those circumstances , there would be a risk that a direct comparison of the fines imposed on the addressees of the two decisions concerning different infringements would distort the specific functions which take place in the various stages of the calculation of the fine .
R925	The final amounts of the fines reflect the particular circumstances of each cartel . ( see paras 345 , 347 , 350 - 351 ) When applying the private investor principle of a market economy , the operation under paragraph 1 may only be carried out under the following conditions : ( a ) the recapitalisation may take place only after the formal commitment has been signed and without reservation of the guarantee of the successful completion of the operation by Deutsche Bank and , where appropriate , other financial institutions , except in cases of force majeure , acts of war , terrorist actions and the like ; ( b ) state participation is subject to the condition that the new shares are subscribed with the same rights , under the same conditions , at the same uniform price and at the same time as private investors , according to the calendar provided for the granting of a guarantee of successful completion by Deutsche Bank and , where appropriate , other guarantee banks ; ( c ) the operation may not be encumbered by any ancillary or implicit agreements whereby the Italian State could relieve the banks of their obligations in the event that the offer of shares in the recapitalisation was not sufficiently subscribed to in the market or could give them any special discount to the issue price .
R926	If the law does not forbid this , the court may order the witnesses to be questioned . Witnesses shall be summoned by the court office at least eight days before the date of the hearing .

In order to settle the dispute or prevent the dispute from arising , the court may order an expert investigation . the investigation may concern only actual findings and technical advice ( section 962 JudC. ) . the expert will carry out his task under the supervision of the court . The parties provide the expert with all requisite documents and meet all reasonable demands from him . If the report conflicts with the court 's own convinced belief , the court is not obliged to follow the expert 's advice . The court may , of its own motion or on application by the parties , order an investigation in situ ( section 1007 JudC. ) .

In the decision imposing fines pursuant to Article 3 , the Commission may also provide for periodic penalty payments to be imposed on the recognised organisation if it fails to take corrective action , or if it is acting with undue delays in the conclusion of an infringement . OR WASTE MATERIALS DERIVED FROM SUCH MEDICINAL PRODUCTS , IF APPROPRIATE After excluding property that should not have been transferred to Mesta AS , and making adjustments based on the simulated continuity principle , the value was estimated at NOK 277 million . After changing the valuation principles from simulated continuity to fair value , the properties were valued by an independent reality expert , OPAK . The Norwegian authorities submitted an expert report of 28 August 2002 in which OPAK set a value of 375 property to approximately NOK 336 million ( 70 ) . The subsequent report of 31 October 2002 , drawn up by OPAK , provided that , inter alia , with the addition of 16 properties , the approximate value of real estate was NOK 395 million .
R928	Ernst & Young clarified that , following the exclusion of property which should not have been transferred to Mesta AS , and after repairing the rented real estate ( 71 ) , the value of the real estate was subsequently reduced to NOK 331 million ( 72 ) . The December 2002 report entitled ' Opening balance sheet - Addendum : valuation of assets' shows that , although the value of the real estate , based on the principle of the simulated continuity principle , was NOK 596 million , application of the fair value principle resulted in a value of NOK 331 million . Determination of the value based on the discounted cash flow In parallel to the valuation of the individual assets ( but separately ) , the fair value of the whole company was determined as a going concern on the basis of the discounted cash flow method , which was summarised in the October 2002 report entitled ' Value measurement ' , prepared by Ernst & Young ( 73 ) . The report concludes that working capital ( 74 ) is approximately NOK 600 million ( in the range of + /- 25 % ) using the discounted cash flow method . The analysis was based on a cash flow valuation for the period 2003 - 2012 , for which a negative present value of NOK 300 million was assumed , and a positive terminal value of NOK 900 million ( 75 ) .

R975	What is the validity of such measures ? Is there a possibility of appeal against the decision granting such a measure ? What does enforcement mean in civil and commercial matters ? If a debtor fails to comply voluntarily with a legal judgment , the claimant can enforce compliance through the courts ; this is known as compulsory enforcement . It requires an enforceable title ( Article 1386 of the Judicial Code ) , because it involves an intrusion into the debtor 's personal legal sphere . This title is usually a judgment or a notarial deed . compulsory enforcement is usually used for the purpose of recovering money , but it can also be used to enforce performance of an act . is a means of exerting pressure on the person convicted in order to encourage compliance with a judicial decision . However , payment of a fine can not be ordered in certain cases : when the person concerned has been sentenced to pay a sum of money or to comply with an employment contract and if this would be incompatible with human dignity . payment of a fine is enforced on the basis of the title for which it is issued , so that no further title is required . In the case of a person sentenced to pay a sum of money , the claim is enforced against the debtor 's assets and is referred to as attachment .
R976	This exemption is total , i.e. the person concerned does not pay any court costs , appeal costs or enforcement costs . In addition , a person who is exempted from court costs may apply for legal aid in the form of a lawyer appointed by the court . If the application for a lawyer is granted , the lawyer 's fees are covered by the opponent of the party for whom a lawyer is appointed . Where that person loses the case , the lawyer 's costs are borne by the State to the State .

Therefore , Sweden was requested to submit any comments which could be relevant for the investigation of the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2005 . The comments received from the Swedish Government by letter of 9 July 2003 expressly refer to the period in respect of which the Commission requested information . The Swedish Government has exercised its right of defence for the entire period . third parties were given the opportunity to comment on the application of the aid scheme in respect of the same period . Svenskt näringsliv submitted its comments on the exemption from energy tax by letter of 29 September 2003 . Therefore , the third party 's right to deliver an opinion has been respected .
