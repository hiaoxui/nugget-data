L48	The legislator considers compensation for damage resulting from an offence causing death , serious detriment to health , disturbance of the functioning of a bodily organ or disturbance to health , an offence against safety in traffic or an offence against the environment , property or business transactions to be the integral part of a judgment on the offender 's criminal liability . There is no problem if the victim wishes to lodge a motion already in the preparatory proceedings , yet it is the court that decides on its effectiveness in the concluding judgment . In such a case , the court adjudicates ( obligatorily ) on the obligation to compensate for the damage in whole or in part . The court may not refuse to impose this obligation if the offender 's guilt and the damage caused have both been proved . In case of doubts concerning the scope of the damage caused , the court should make suitable arrangements in this respect . Pursuant to Article 46 of the Criminal Code , in respect of the obligation to compensate for damage , the provisions of civil law on prescription of claims and the possibility to adjudge an annuity do not apply . This solution should be considered beneficial for the victim , bearing in mind that limitation periods for sentencing are , especially with regard to the mentioned list of offences , longer than they are in the civil law .

In exceptional cases a party make take interim measures , but then must immediately report them for ratification by the court . The assets seized will then be frozen , though still held by the third party , who can not dispose of them , and a forced sale can be ordered only with the approval of the court . As has been seen , the court 's authorisation may in some cases be obtained by simple application with supporting documents and explanations . The court 's order will be made on the basis of the information supplied to it unilaterally . What court has competence for ordering such measures ? The rules on jurisdiction are usually determined by the statutory provision empowering the court to order an interim measure . There is no general rule of jurisdiction except that the power to order interim measures usually lies with the President of the court trying the case on the merits .
L50	Where no specific procedure is provided for , a party wishing a measure to be ordered must apply to the urgent applications court . Depending on the amount at stake , this will mean the cantonal court ( juge de paix - up to € 10 000 ) or the urgent applications judge at the district court . They have general jurisdiction to order interim or precautionary measures either to preclude imminent degradation of assets or to bring a halt to a manifestly unlawful breach of order ( section 933 of the New Code of Civil Procedure ) . But there are exceptional procedures , often highly technical , in which a lawyer will be essential . Where the court has ordered assets to be attached , for instance , the order will have to be enforced by a bailiff . Perhaps it was equally superfluous to seek the command room .

L59	Upon receipt of a recommendation referred to in the preceding paragraph , the Association Committee shall , within a reasonable time , review the recommendation with a view to determining whether it is consistent with this Title . The director 's term of office is generally 4 - 5 years . Most of the basic Regulations nevertheless provide for the director 's term of office and , where applicable , that of the deputies , to be extended for one or more further periods . The conditions governing appointment and term of office are laid down in each basic Regulation for each agency . Apart from Regulation ( EEC ) No 1360/90 establishing a European Training Foundation and , more recently , Regulation ( EC ) No 851/2004 establishing a European Centre for disease prevention and control , the basic Regulations for the Community agencies use the term " renewal " to refer to extending the director 's term of office . In the Treaty establishing the European Community , Article 214(1 ) ( on appointing Commission Members ) and Articles 223 and 225 ( on appointing Court of Justice Judges ) contain the same provision . Yet in both cases it is agreed that the possibility of renewal does not mean that a simplified procedure is applicable or that the term of office may be extended without complying with the appointment procedure laid down in the Treaty .
L60	Moreover , agency directors and their deputies are not only office - holders but also agency staff members employed under temporary contracts and subject to the Conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities . The appointment procedure must therefore include publication of the post in all Member States and a selection process in compliance with the rules deriving from the basic Regulations and the Conditions of employment of other servants . They may also slow up or hamper the agency 's work during this period , if the incumbent director decides to reapply . Given the agencies' special needs and the practice in past years , it therefore does not seem appropriate to conduct a full selection procedure each time that the first term of office for a director 's or other relevant person 's post comes to an end . In accordance with Article 4(1)(c ) of Regulation ( EEC ) No 2408/92 , any carrier intending to operate any one of these routes must undertake to do so for at least twelve consecutive months .

L81	In my view , these questions should be answered in the negative . Communication from the Commission of 6 February 2004 to the Council , the European Parliament , the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Report on the Implementation of the Commission 's Action Plan for Skills and Mobility [ COM(2004 ) 66 final - Not published in the Official Journal ] . Against a background of general slowdown in economic activity ( in 2002 , growth in GDP in the EU was around 1 % , whereas it was forecast at 0.8 % in 2003 ) , the consequent reduction in job vacancies is likely to reduce the propensity to move between jobs and may therefore have a negative impact on overall mobility rates . Nevertheless , in weighing up the positive and negative aspects so far , the report points out that occupational mobility has benefited from the adoption of a series of benchmarks by the Council to be achieved by 2010 , and a Europass framework to support the transparency and transferability of qualifications . Information and the transparency of job opportunities have also been encouraged by positive measures such as the opening of the European Job Mobility Portal , the launch of the mobility information campaign and the modernisation of EURES . The Commission also underlines the growing importance being attached to these issues in the current Employment Guidelines and the associated work under the Education and Training programme .
L82	The new European Employment Strategy , agreed by the Council on 22 July 2003 , calls upon the Member States to improve , in particular , the recognition and transparency of qualifications and competences and the transferability of social security and pension rights , providing appropriate incentives in tax and benefit systems , and taking into account labour market aspects of immigration . It also calls for job - seekers throughout the EU to be able , by 2005 , to consult all job vacancies advertised through the Member States ' employment services . The Member States are further encouraged to implement lifelong learning strategies geared closely to the future objectives of the education and training systems .

L87	It was necessary to stand in a queue at railway stations in order to get tickets for the Strela . " It is hard to say whether celebrities traveled with the Strela , but it is certain that it was used by the wealthy and by businessmen , " says Monsport . According to its original specifications , the Slovenská Strela could run on the tracks at a speed of up to 130 km / h. However , during its tests it was able to run 18 km / h faster . Czechoslovak Railways put two fast trains into scheduled operation on the Prague - Bratislava route for the first time on 13 July 1936 . The journey time was eventually reduced from the original 4 hours 51 minutes to 4 hours 18 minutes . " For that time it was something revolutionary . A picture exists by a photographer - I think from a Brno paper - who wanted to photograph the Slovenská Strela running . Only his photograph survived ; he managed to press the release , " says Tatra enthusiast Karel Rozenkranz . This was apparently the first tragic victim of the Slovenská Strela . The separation of Slovakia and the occupation of Bohemia , Moravia and Silesia in 1939 put an end to the express train connection between the largest cities of the prewar Republic . During the war both Slovenská Strela coaches stood at a railway depot . The ownership of background should not be affected by the project .

L108	Summary Transactions in which a taxable person established in a Member State buys goods from companies established in that Member State and sells them to purchasers established in another Member State , and which are not themselves vitiated by value added tax fraud , constitute supplies of goods or services effected by a taxable person acting as such and an economic activity within the meaning of Articles 2(1 ) , 4 and 5(1 ) of Sixth Directive 77/388 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes where they fulfil the objective criteria on which the definitions of those terms are based , regardless of the intention of a trader other than the taxable person concerned involved in the same chain of supply and/or the possible fraudulent nature of another transaction in the chain , prior or subsequent to the transaction carried out by that taxable person , of which that taxable person had no knowledge and no means of knowledge . The right to deduct input value added tax of a taxable person who carries out such transactions can not be affected by the fact that in the chain of supply of which those transactions form part another prior or subsequent transaction is vitiated by value added tax fraud , without that taxable person knowing or having any means of knowing .

L110	Spousal Maintenance Spousal maintenance is provided by the Marriage Act . In Finnish legal practice , it is rare for a spouse to be obliged to pay maintenance to the other spouse . As a rule , after the divorce , the spouses support themselves . Maintenance can be confirmed payable until further notice or for a period of time stipulated by an agreement / decision / judgment . However , the liable party can be ordered to pay maintenance in a lump sum if the liable party 's financial circumstances and other factors justify it . Maintenance can also be paid in movable property or real property . Due to rises in living costs , an automatic increase applies to maintenance paid periodically . The automatic increase is provided in detail by the Act on Raising Certain Maintenance Payments to Reflect Living Costs . A decision or judgment passed by a court of justice , or an agreement between the spouses can be amended if it is deemed necessary due to a change in circumstances .

L112	It is enough for the subject - matter of that party 's application and the main elements of fact and of law on which it is based to be set out sufficiently clearly in that application ( see judgment of 15 January 2013 in Case T - 451/11 Gigabyte Technology v OHIM - Haskins ( Gigabyte ) , not published in the ECR , paragraph 28 and the case - law cited ) , which is the situation in the present case . 18 It is sufficiently clear from the application that , in essence , the applicant is alleging an infringement of Article 8(1)(b ) of Regulation No 207/2009 , since it submits that the Board of Appeal erred in law in finding that the signs in question were similar and that there was accordingly a likelihood of confusion between them . Moreover , it expressly refers to that provision in its reply . 19 Furthermore , the applicant 's reasoning is sufficiently clear and precise to enable OHIM and the intervener to prepare their defence and for the General Court to exercise its jurisdiction to review legality ( see , to that effect , Gigabyte , paragraph 29 and the case - law cited ) . Indeed , OHIM and the intervener dispute the applicant 's arguments in their entirety : in its response , OHIM has even expressly referred to the plea alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b ) of Regulation No 207/2009 .
L113	Substance 21 Article 8(1)(b ) of Regulation No 207/2009 provides that , upon opposition by the proprietor of an earlier trade mark , the trade mark applied for is not to be registered if , because of its identity with , or similarity to , the earlier trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by the trade marks , there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public in the territory in which the earlier trade mark is protected . The likelihood of confusion includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade mark . 22 It is settled law that the risk that the public might believe that the goods or services in question come from the same undertaking or from economically linked undertakings constitutes a likelihood of confusion .

L121	The measure at issue , namely the Belgian authorities' refusal to finance the furniture and teaching equipment of the European Schools established in the Kingdom of Belgium , stems from interpretation of the scope of obligations contained in an agreement ( the Establishment Agreement ) adopted on the basis of the 1957 Convention . Pursuant to paragraphs 37 and 38 of Hurd , since such an agreement falls outside the field of application of the provisions of the Treaty and of the duty of genuine cooperation as expressed in Article 10 EC , the same is true , in my view , of the refusal to implement obligations allegedly arising from that agreement . I take the view that to find otherwise would exceed the jurisdiction conferred on the Court because , in order to establish the alleged failure to fulfil obligations under Article 10 EC , the Court would be led to define the scope of the obligations arising from the Establishment Agreement . Decisions entrusting implementing tasks to the entities or persons referred to in Article 56 of the Financial Regulation shall include all appropriate arrangements for ensuring the transparency of operations carried out .

L126	In those circumstances , the levying of such a tax is not on any view liable to prohibit , impede or otherwise make less attractive the provision of advertising services to be carried out in the territory of the municipalities concerned , including the case in which the provision of services is of a cross - border nature on account of the place of establishment of either the provider or the recipient of the services . 39 It follows from the foregoing considerations that Article 49 EC must be interpreted as not precluding the levying of a tax such as the municipal tax on advertising imposed by Legislative Decree No 507/93 . Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court , other than the costs of those parties , are not recoverable . What gaseous fuels are used as vehicle propellant ?

In other words , the government exercises total control over NPC ; 4 ) NPC is responsible for the development and operation of the country 's petrochemical sector and for this reason has been entrusted to manage the Petrochemical Special Economic Zone . As regards the existence of a benefit conferred upon the recipient company , the investigation established that STPC , as currently constituted , could not continue to operate without the financial support of NPC . This practice is inconsistent with the usual investment practice of private investors since no commercial organisation would continue to inject such non - repayable funding . This NPC financing intervention is specific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(a ) of the basic Regulation , given that the granting authority explicitly limits access to that subsidy only to STPC , in line with its policy to develop the Petrochemical Sector .

Finally , for its upcoming reform of labour code , the Ukrainian government has openly committed to explicitly prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation . While the anti - discrimination legislation was improved to provide for the necessary legislative basis to ensure the implementation of the benchmarks in the anti - discrimination area , additional legal guarantees will need to be given in the implementation phase to ensure that protection against discrimination on the basis of all grounds as well as procedural guarantees are sufficiently and effectively ensured and any derogation is applied in line with the principles of necessity and proportionality in the Ukrainian legal system . In addition to the provisions to guarantee protection against discrimination , the Commission 's third report also underlined that the Commission would closely monitor any further developments on the pending draft laws 0711 ( subsequently 0945 ) and 0290 . These proposed to amend various laws and to limit freedom of speech by banning ' propaganda of homosexuals' . The government of Ukraine has given assurances that these draft laws have been withdrawn from the registry in the parliament .

L153	24 As is apparent from Articles 1 and 2 of Regulation No 2670/81 , each manufacturer must , in principle , export the C sugar which it has produced . 25 To that end , the second subparagraph of Article 2(2 ) of that regulation provides for a mechanism enabling a manufacturer to replace the quantity of C sugar for export by another sugar under quota produced by another manufacturer established on the territory of the same Member State . It thus follows from that provision that , by an accounting alteration , the replacement sugar , first falling within the category of C sugar , acquires the status of sugar under quota and may be freely put into circulation in the internal market by the manufacturer , while the replacement sugar , initially produced under quota , is exported as C sugar . 26 Secondly , it must be borne in mind that Article 8(1 ) and ( 2 ) of the basic regulation institutes a compensation system for sugar storage costs , under which the Member States are bound to make flat - rate reimbursement to the manufacturers of the costs which they incur for that storage . In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 26(1 ) of that regulation , only the costs incurred for the storage of sugar produced within the A and B quotas can be reimbursed , the storage costs of C sugar being excluded .

ANNEX PIRAEUS BANK - COMMITMENTS BY THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC The Hellenic Republic shall ensure that the Bank is implementing the restructuring plan submitted on 25 June 2014 . The restructuring plan is based on macroeconomic assumptions as provided by the European Commission ( the ' Commission' ) in the Appendix as well as regulatory assumptions .
L169	The Commitments include the commitments regarding to the implementation of the restructuring plan ( the ' Restructuring Commitments ' ) and the Commitments on Corporate Governance and Commercial Operations . The Commitments shall take effect upon the date of adoption of the Commission 's decision approving the restructuring plan ( the ' Decision' ) . The restructuring period shall end on 31 December 2018 . The Commitments apply throughout the restructuring period unless the individual Commitment states otherwise . This text shall be interpreted in the light of the Decision in the general framework of Union law , and by reference to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 659/1999 ( 1 ) . Therefore , it includes the entire Piraeus Bank Group with all its Greek and non - Greek subsidiaries and branches , both banking and non - banking . Such a controlled liquidation , possibly carried out in conjunction with a contribution of public funds , may be applied in individual cases , either as a second step , after rescue aid to an individual financial institution when it becomes clear that the latter can not be restructured successfully , or in one single action . Controlled winding - up may also constitute an element of a general guarantee scheme , e.g. where a Member State undertakes to initiate liquidation of the financial institutions for which the guarantee needs to be activated .
L170	The banking licence should be withdrawn as soon as possible . In ensuring that the aid amount is kept to the minimum necessary in view of the objective pursued , it needs to be taken into account that the protection of financial stability within the current financial turmoil may imply the necessity to reimburse certain creditors of the liquidated bank through aid measures . The choice of criteria for the selection of the types of liabilities for this purpose should follow the same rules as in relation to the liabilities covered by a guarantee scheme . In order to ensure that no aid is granted to the buyers of the financial institution or parts of it or to the entities sold , it is important that certain sales conditions are respected . Where the application of these criteria leads to the finding of aid to buyers or to sold entities , the compatibility of that aid will have to be assessed separately . Sparkles , meet Adam . Adam , Sparkles . Okay . Sparkles ? Yeah . I rescued her from a bleak situation , so I got to change up her energy , hence the ... the little puff - ball headgear and the , uh , the baby " T " that says " princess . " Yeah , well , maybe you can adopt me along with Sparkles . Yeah , you 'd look pretty cute in faux fur . Oh , everyone deals differently .

But he soon learned another explanation . As he strained his eyes to peer through the dawn , he saw a sharp flash of green light from the far side of the village . It startled him so much that he almost leaped to his feet to see what had happened . Most of them were vaguely human in outline . Eyes were out of place , malformed ; noses and mouths bulged in skin that was contorted like clay which had been squeezed between strong fingers ; and in some cases all the flesh of face and scalp oozed fluid as if the entire head were a running sore . Some had backs bent at demented angles , others bore extra arms or legs , still others wore their heads between their shoulder blades or in the center of their chests . Your name ?

They could 've phoned from the lobby . It does n't follow . - Maybe they had a beer . Not these boys . The civil rights office in Rossville started making calls when they did n't check in .

I can kill you , but can I kill every man in Zhao ? 21.A.239 Design assurance system ( a ) Contrary to the submissions of the Odvolací finanční ředitelství , that finding can not be called into question by the fact that , as EU law stands at present , gift tax is not harmonised and therefore falls within the competence of the Member States . The Member States must exercise that competence consistently with EU law , ( 8 ) for , in accordance with Article 4(3 ) TEU , they are to refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the European Union 's objectives . The same holds for the other laws on national insurance , namely the General law on family benefits ( Algemene Kinderbijslagwet ) , the General law on survivors ( Algemene Nabestaandenwet ) and the General law on sickness insurance ( Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten ) .
L174	' The basis for calculation of the national insurance contributions shall be the contribution income of the person liable.' 11 Under Article 8 of the WFV , ' contribution income' is defined as the taxable income or the taxable domestic income for the purposes of the Netherlands Law on income tax ( Wet op de inkomstenbelasting , ' the WIB' ) . The real economic value of the assets as a result of impairments is lower than the transfer value . In accordance with point 41 of the IAC , a far - reaching restructuring of the bank is consequently required . In this context , it is undisputable that without the aid NR would have been technically insolvent . This is furthermore evidenced by the waivers obtained by NR from the FSA , firstly to include all its Tier-2 capital to its regulatory capital position and subsequently to operate below regulatory capital requirements . From the submission of the UK authorities it appears that if the bank was not split - up , a capital injection of at least GBP 6 billion ( for comparison , before the crisis , the bank 's capital was less than GBP 2 billion ) would be necessary for the bank to be viable . Without the State intervention , the split - up of NR and the subsequent continuation of its economic activities by BankCo would not have been possible . You remember me , right ? And schedule is ...
L175	We can talk about the schedule later . I have to go to a meeting at 2 p.m. , so I 'll go ahead . Director , the wedding is tomorrow . You have n't changed a bit !

My honey looks perfect , but he 's slow in matters of love . That 's his only weakness . I heard my honey dumped you pretty badly ? Are you still going on blind dates ? Characteristics in elderly patients After twice daily dosing of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg / mL , the mean AUC0 - 24hr value of 0.0634 ng•hr / ml bimatoprost in the elderly ( subjects 65 years or older ) were significantly higher than 0.0218 ng•hr / ml in young healthy adults . However , this finding is not clinically relevant as systemic exposure for both elderly and young subjects remained very low from ocular dosing . Effects in non - clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use .
L176	These doses resulted in systemic exposures of at least 33- or 97-times higher , respectively , than the intended human exposure .

L178	Pursuant to Article 17(1 ) of Order No 18/2007 , the initial procedure for affiliation to a private pension fund was to extend over a period of four months , which commenced on 17 September 2007 and ended on 17 January 2008 ( Article 5(6 ) of Order No 18/2007 ) . During that period , any persons who had not reached the age of 35 by 31 December 2007 , or who reached that age on that date , and who met certain other requirements , were obliged to join a private pension fund ( Article 4(1 ) and Article 5(3 ) of Order No 18/2007 ) . Financial compensation : The tenders submitted will specify the amount required by way of compensation for operating each service for 3 years from the scheduled start date ( with an annual breakdown ) . The exact amount of compensation finally granted will be determined annually ' ex post' on the basis of the costs and revenue actually generated by the service , within the limits of the amount stated in the tender . The annual payments will be made in the form of instalments and a balance . The balance will be paid only after approval of the carrier 's accounts for the routes in question and verification that the service has been operated in accordance with the conditions laid down in point 8 below .

L180	15 By judgment of 7 November 2006 , the Tribunal administratif de Marseille ( Administrative Court , Marseilles ) annulled the enforcement order issued against Syndicat OP 84 . However , by judgment of 8 December 2008 , the Cour administrative d'appel de Marseille ( Administrative Court of Appeal , Marseilles ) set aside the judgment at first instance and dismissed the claims submitted by Syndicat OP 84 to the Tribunal administratif de Marseille . Syndicat OP 84 thereupon lodged an appeal in cassation before the Conseil d'État ( Council of State ) . 16 Syndicat OP 84 submits inter alia a ground of appeal alleging that the Cour administrative d'appel de Marseille erred in law in holding that the authorities could , without misapplying Article 2 of Regulation No 4045/89 , commence an inspection during the scrutiny period falling between 1 July 1999 and 30 June 2000 , and continue it during the scrutiny period falling between 1 July 2000 and 30 June 2001 , on the ground that Syndicat OP 84 's conduct had made it impossible actually to carry out an inspection during the first of those periods . 17 On the view that consideration of that ground of appeal raises questions regarding the interpretation of the relevant provisions of Regulation No 4045/89 , the Conseil d'État decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling : " You must find it .

The following scale of premiums applies : Specific Comments Complex issues of policy , principle and law are raised in the Green Paper . Member States have themselves developed a corpus of consumer law which , though often consistent between countries in its broad principles , varies in detail and application .
L184	The systematic and extended consultation process annexed to the document reflects this complexity . In this Opinion , however , the EESC confines its comments to the underlying major policy issues , because it considers that each directive to be reviewed should be commented on separately , as in its Opinion on the directive on distance contracts [ Opinion INT/334 on the Commission Communication COM(2006 ) 514 final , of 21 September 2006 ] . The main priority should be in making good the deficits in the existing Directives and co - ordinating them with each other . Nevertheless , it also recognises the view that various categories of consumers throughout the EU are disadvantaged in their current level of protection or capacity to seek redress and action is needed at both EU and Member State level . This does not mean that , in a case - by - case examination , in very specific areas in which completion of the internal market is the prime concern , the possibility of maximum harmonisation should not be considered , provided that a higher level of consumer protection is ensured , possibly through regulation . The stated aim of putting the consumer in the driving seat - in terms of knowledge of consumer rights , their capacity to take action against suppliers and obtain redress - should not be seen as an alternative to clear and proactively enforced protection through a combination of EU and national law . Information is a very different thing from protection .

Under Article 151 of the Civil Procedure Act ( ZPP - see below under Further information ) , legal costs cover expenditure incurred in the course of or as a result of proceedings , and fees for the work of lawyers and of other persons whose entitlement is recognised by law ( e.g. legal experts ) . Initially , the parties themselves bear the costs arising from their actions . Repayment of costs in civil and commercial cases is governed by the ZPP , while repayment in social cases and employment disputes is governed by the Labour and Social Courts Act ( see below under Further information ) . This presentation concentrates solely on the system for repaying costs in civil and commercial cases .
L197	The basic rule is that costs are repaid to the successful party . Under the first paragraph of Article 154 ZPP , the unsuccessful party in the action repays the costs of the proceedings to the opposing party and any party intervening at its side . Special rules apply where costs arise through the fault of a particular party , where the judgment is based on an acknowledgement of the plaintiff 's claim , where the claim is withdrawn and where the court reaches a settlement in cases where there are co - defendants or co - plaintiffs ( Articles 155 - 162 ZPP ) . Under Article 1 of the Free Legal Aid Act ( ZBPP - see below under Further information ) , free legal aid is a means of allowing persons to assert their right to legal protection - in line with the principle of equality and taking account of their social circumstances - where they would otherwise be unable to do so without harming their ability to maintain themselves and their family . A person entitled to free legal aid may claim funds to meet the costs of legal help in full or in part and exemption from the costs of court proceedings . Can I benefit from legal aid ? Your financial position is assessed on the basis of your monthly income and that of your family , and the property owned by yourself and by your family .

L227	Businesses are not taking sufficient advantage of the internet 's potential to boost sales : Union law can help by increasing businesses ' need for legal certainty and at the same time guaranteeing the highest level of consumer protection . Consumers need to be aware of their rights and provided with access to redress in cross - border cases . Finally , the increased use of alternative dispute resolution can contribute to the efficient administration of justice . Criminal law is a relatively novel area of EU action for which the Treaty of Lisbon sets a clear legal framework . A criminal justice strategy , fully respecting subsidiarity and coherence , should guide the EU 's policy for the approximation of substantive and procedural criminal law . It should be pursued in close cooperation with European Parliament , national parliaments and the Council and acknowledge that focus will remain primarily on mutual recognition and the harmonisation of offences and sanctions will be pursued for selected cases . The administration of justice must not be impeded by unjustifiable differences between the Member States' judicial systems : criminals should not be able to avoid prosecution and prison by crossing borders and exploiting differences between national legal systems . A solid common European procedural base is needed . A new and comprehensive system for obtaining evidence in cross - border cases and better exchange of information between Member States' authorities on offences committed are essential tools to developing a functioning area of freedom , security and justice .

L233	- airports , aviation - related services and the aircraft manufacturing industry would benefit from an increase in air transport , - the increase in traffic would facilitate a further increase in trade and tourism flows . 4.6 The clear potential benefits of an Open Aviation Area Agreement with Australia have been confirmed in an impact assessment study carried out by independent consultants . While the short - term economic benefits may be relatively limited due to the absence of non - stop flights between the Community and Australia and the already existing degree of market access , the economic impact of an agreement with Australia would nonetheless be considerable . The recent study has confirmed that the regulatory and policy framework for air transport in Australia would allow the Community to achieve a model agreement with Australia which would result in greater levels of regulatory convergence and new opportunities for EU industry and users . An OAA with Australia could increase the competitiveness of EU airlines vis - à - vis competitors from the Middle and Far East in the EU - Australia market . It could lead to an increase in direct flights between the EU and Australia and to a better distribution of air traffic which today is highly concentrated on London . It could lead to more one - stop services between EU cities and Australian destinations , thereby increasing the convenience for EU passengers .

A great deal of work had already been put into the place , but by the end of the second summer there was general agreement that it would be better to cut their losses . To build a community they had to think in terms of years - a considerable number of years .

Its persistence results from direct and indirect discrimination against women and structural inequalities , such as segregation in sectors , occupations and work patterns , career breaks for child and other family care , access to education and training , biased evaluation and pay systems and stereotypes . Technical , human and financial resources are not necessarily available in all Member States .

L288	However , actual costs incurred do include also the reclassified factory overhead costs . The fact that the company operated at a fraction of its full capacity of production does not mean that costs arising from such facilities are not incurred . Indeed , such costs were booked in the company 's accounting records and since they were directly linked to production of the like product , a correction of the reported cost of manufacturing had to be done . In the absence of domestic sales of the like product and data on the same general category of products , during the investigation period , SG&A expenses were determined in accordance with Article 2(6)(c ) of the basic Regulation . With regard to profit , and in the absence of any other reasonable basis , a profit margin of 5 % was used . A second co - operating exporting producer had representative domestic sales of the like product in its domestic market . However , sales in the ordinary course of trade were not made in sufficient quantities for normal value to be based on actual domestic prices .

In that reasoned opinion , it was stated inter alia that ' to date , no verification of compliance has taken place' . In its application , the Commission mentions the same complaint , again without referring to the period for which it criticises Luxembourg for having failed to fulfil its obligations under the provisions of that article .
L295	In those circumstances , and in the absence of other relevant indicia , the subject - matter of the action concerning Directive 98/10 can not go beyond the scope of what was stated in the letter of formal notice . The lack of interest in bringing proceedings 42 The Luxembourg Government contends , first , that the present action is inadmissible because , at the expiry of the period fixed in the reasoned opinion of 11 July 2003 , the alleged failure to fulfil obligations had ended because Directive 98/10 was no longer in force . As to Directive 97/33 , the Community legislature had already adopted the NRF applicable to communications before sending the reasoned opinion of 21 March 2002 . As for the line of case - law in which it has been held that , where Community law is amended during the course of the pre - litigation procedure , the Commission has standing to seek a declaration that a Member State has failed to fulfil obligations which were created in the initial version of a Community measure , subsequently amended or repealed , and which were maintained in force under the new provisions ( Case C - 363/00 Commission v Italy [ 2003 ] ECR I-5767 , paragraph 22 ) , the Luxembourg Government contends that it is not applicable to the present case .

GENERAL DESCRIPTION The EIPP , created pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation ( EU ) 2015/1017 is a publicly available web portal of investment projects within the Union which acts as a platform to promote projects to potential investors worldwide . EIPP 's main goal is to catalyse and accelerate the development and the fruition of investment projects in the Union , and through this , to contribute to higher employment and economic growth .
L313	In the event that no such signature takes place by 26 May 2006 , the Commission shall promptly publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union announcing that no such signature has taken place and that countermeasures as provided for in Regulation ( EC ) No 2193/2003 become applicable again with effect from 30 May 2006 . The document also analyses the potential cohesion situation in an enlarged Europe . This part of the report addresses growth in GDP and employment in the cohesion countries over recent years relative to that in the rest of the EU and looks at how disparities between regions in the EU15 have changed over the past decade , with particular focus on the Objective 1 regions . It also analyses recent economic developments in the new Member States , in particular the way that economic performance varies within these countries and the fact that if these countries are to attain income levels close to the EU average , they will need to sustain high rates of growth for a prolonged period . The report also highlights Europe 's ageing population and factors determining competitiveness , growth and employment , such as innovation and knowledge , along with environmental protection in the context of the Gothenburg objectives .
L314	2.5 General aspects Over the last decade , and in particular since the second half of the 1990s , national and regional cohesion has improved significantly , with a narrowing of disparities both between countries and between regions in the EU . Nonetheless , there has been greater cohesion between Member States than between regions . Despite the positive contribution of the Structural Funds and progress achieved , some very significant differences remain in terms of prosperity and economic performance , reflecting structural weaknesses in some countries and regions . There also remain a number of problems relating to the competitiveness of less prosperous regions . Some European regions are still too isolated and fall short in terms of skilled labour , investment and the resources necessary to gain proper access to the information society . Less progress seems to have been made in terms of social cohesion and employment : it is proving difficult to make a dent in long - term unemployment ; the limited increase in employment in the EU15 in 2001 , combined with a fall in employment in the accession countries in recent years , has further exacerbated regional disparities ; natural population growth has fallen in various European regions and is set to decline even further in the future ( demographic projections predict a decline in the Member States and accession countries , with a few exceptions ) ; Somebody call it !

IP/11/629 A credible , fair and effective EU migration policy : the way forward The Commission is proposing a package of measures aimed at a better management of migration flows from the Southern Mediterranean region , as well as amendments to the Visa Regulation to ensure that visa free travel does not lead to abuse . CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSALS The Commission adopted its proposal[1 ] for the 7th Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community ( Euratom ) for nuclear research and training activities ( 2007 to 2011 ) on 6 April 2005 . The Commission indicated that the activities were to be organised in two Specific Programmes corresponding to " indirect " actions on fusion energy research and nuclear fission and radiation protection and the " direct " research activities of the Joint Research Centre in the field of nuclear energy , and these are the subject of the present proposals . The policy context and objectives are those set out in the Communication " Building the ERA of knowledge for growth " [2 ] .
L318	Financial support at a European level offers opportunities to increase the excellence and effectiveness of research in a way that can not be achieved at national level . The Specific Programmes of the 7th Euratom Framework Programme represent further consolidation of the European Research Area in this sector , achieving critical mass and structures in new areas of research and by new means , and further supporting the free movement of ideas , knowledge and researchers . Throughout the implementation of the Specific Programmes , the potential for European level actions to strengthen excellence in research will be utilised to the maximum . This implies identifying and supporting existing excellence in this field wherever it exists across the European Union as well as creating capacities for future research excellence . Where possible , the impact of the Specific Programmes will be enhanced through complementarities with other Community programmes , such as the Structural Funds . This is in conformity with the approach to be followed in the EC Capacities Specific Programme , since an important aspect of the Euratom Specific Programme for indirect actions will also be the support for research infrastructures , though in this case in the specific area of nuclear science and technology .

L326	However , if the parents separate and the child has its home with the mother only , it can then take and follow the domicile of the mother , even though the domicile of origin was based on that of the father . For persons over 16 , their previous domicile continues to apply unless they take a domicile of choice . To adopt a domicile of choice , the person must live in the relevant country and intend to continue doing so indefinitely or permanently . If a domicile of choice is abandoned , the domicile of origin will revive to fill any gap until a new domicile of choice may be acquired . The domicile of married persons is assessed independently of that of the other spouse , although clearly they are likely to have the same domicile if they are living together . The issue of whether a person is domiciled in a particular country will generally be decided by Scots law , in the absence of any provision to the contrary in e.g. an international instrument to which the UK is party . The right to name a child is part of parental rights and responsibilities , and if disputed the court would probably make a decision according to Scots law , which would require the welfare of the child to be treated as paramount .

Interested parties may submit their comments on the aid in respect of which the Commission is initiating the procedure within one month of the date of publication of this summary and the following letter , to : Confidential treatment of the identity of the interested party submitting the comments may be requested in writing , stating the reasons for the request . Allegedly , where public forest estates were exchanged for private ones , the Bulgarian State realised a price lower than the market value . Both the swap and the change of use of the land were based on Bulgarian legislation that came into force before the Bulgarian accession to the European Union . Both forest land swaps with private parties and subsequent changes to the use of the land were banned , respectively suspended , in 2009 . The complainants require that the alleged aid resulting from the swaps and changes of the status of the land is declared unlawful and incompatible , and is recovered by the Bulgarian authorities . According to the complainants , State aid would be granted in the context of forest swaps in a two - stage process .
L331	At first stage , State - owned forests would be swapped for privately owned ones upon inequitable terms , primarily because of the strategic location of such public forests . Secondly , an approval would be granted by the competent authority for the alteration of the designated status of the former State - owned forest and its inclusion in the urbanised area , which allow development to be undertaken . This scheme would consequently , by cumulation of both steps , allow undertakings to obtain an economic benefit , as the prices for the public land charged in the swap and/or the subsequent change of the use of land would be lower than the market price for comparable land sold on the market . Thus , Article 10(1 ) of the own resources regulation provides that amounts recorded in the B accounts within the time period laid down in that provision are to be entered as of their recovery , and not , as assumed by the Commission , in the A accounts as of their recovery . ' Unlawful introduction' is defined , for present purposes , in Article 202 of the Customs Code , which identifies it as ' any introduction in violation of the provisions of Articles 38 to 41 and the second indent of Article 177' .

To a large extent , the training courses for Security Agents planned by DHL correspond as regards both content and number of hours to the training measures provided for in the national legislation ( Musterlehrplan für Luftsicherheitskontrollkäfte für Personal- und Warenkontrollen ) implementing Regulation ( EC ) No 2320/2002 . The training module IATA PK 7/8 is also mandatory under the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulation ( IATA Gefahrgutvorschriften ) , which was transposed into German legislation by NfL II-36/05 . Only the training courses for the apron driver licence and quality management ( 8 out of a total of more than 300 training hours in both cases ) seem to be additional , i.e. are not required by law .
L333	Similarly , the apron driver licence course appears to be indispensable for Security Agents since they need to have access at all times to the airport taxiway and apron . It would not make sense for the smooth operation of the hub to be endangered because a Security Agent did not have access to the apron ( as explained in recital 90 et seq . , the training can be restricted to a given number of employees ) . Accordingly , the Commission notes that these two training courses would remain unaffected even in the absence of aid . Given the mandatory nature of the training courses for Security Agents referred to in recitals 83 and 84 , the Commission can not accept Germany 's argument that DHL could employ only a minimum number of qualified personnel who would then train the other employees on the job . It is the Commission 's understanding , on the basis of the information provided , that all Security Agents must complete the courses .

They doubted that competitors could fill in any gaps in connectivity resulting from a possible bankruptcy of Cyprus Airways , given the seasonality of the market . As regards the compatibility of the measures with the 2004 Rescue and Restructuring Guidelines , the Cypriot authorities insisted that the 2013 restructuring plan was founded on realistic assumptions and was not underestimating any negative effects stemming from the small fleet or difficulties in realising cost initiatives . The decision was taken and compensations were paid only after the resignations or redundancies had been finalised and thus would not constitute State aid to Cyprus Airways .

Member States therefore have the right to decide which method they will adopt in setting up their plan for allocating allowances and which data and forecasts they will use in determining the emissions authorised for installations during the period fixed by that plan . 37 In this case , the Commission did not take account of the method whereby the Republic of Estonia drew up its plan for allocating allowances . Recitals 5 and 6 of the contested decision show that , in order to determine the total quantity of allowances admissible , the Commission used its own method and that it based its reasoning on basic data chosen by itself and on the Primes model , set up by a Greek expert , ignoring in substance the plan for the allocation of allowances of the Republic of Estonia . In any event , the Republic of Estonia emphasises that the total quantity of emission allowances for allocation under its plan is marginal in the wider context of the Community system for trading greenhouse gas emission allowances . 40 The Republic of Lithuania emphasises that the Commission does not have a general power to authorise the national allocation plan , but merely a power of review limited to the question of the compatibility of the plan with the criteria in Annex III .
L339	41 As a preliminary , the Commission describes the Community system for trading greenhouse gas emission allowances , and observes , in particular , that , during the first period of the system 's application , from 2005 to 2007 , there was , in significant measure , an excessive allocation of allowances in relation to the emissions verified in 2005 and 2006 , so that the benefit of the trading system for the environment was very limited or non - existent . According to the Commission , that excess allocation of allowances was very significant in Estonia , since its verified emissions for 2005 reached 12.62 million tonnes - equivalent of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , whereas its average annual quantity of allowances for the first period was 19 million tonnes - equivalent of CO2 per annum . 42 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland argues that , if the Commission were to be unsuccessful in one of the cases concerning national allocation plans , the price of allowances during the second period would risk falling significantly due to the resulting oversupply of allowances , thereby completely undermining the effects of the Directive as a tool to reduce emissions . In other words , the consequences would be dire .
L340	43 The Commission and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland then argue that , in the contested decision , the Commission did not determine the total quantity of allowances to be allocated by the Republic of Estonia , but fixed a ceiling for that total quantity . b ) When do I have to choose a court other than that in the place where the defendant lives ( court determined by the application of the basic rule ) ? In order to organise cases into groups or ensure expertise , specific legislation may rule that in given cases only one court , e.g. , the metropolitan court , should proceed in the first instance . For example , legal actions relating to industrial property belong to such a group . Sole competence can only be established by the law . The court designated is usually the metropolitan court . Jurisdiction can not be attributed in cases where the sole competence of a particular court is established by law . Unless otherwise agreed by the parties , the designated court has sole competence . C. Where specialised courts have jurisdiction , how can I find out which one I should apply to ? The legal provisions concerning a particular case clearly state the court you should apply to .

The past two seasons were particularly successful for Martina Chylíková : she won two prestigious singing contests - the Amelie Reimann and the Marguerite Ough competitions in the USA . Cast The opening of a new pedestrian crossing point at Ledra Street / Lokmaci in the old town of Nicosia further facilitates people - to - people contacts between the two communities . However , the number of third country nationals crossing the Line illegally remains an area of serious concern . In the reporting period , the total number of detected ( or apprehended ) illegal immigrants doubled , reaching the highest level ever .
L345	The Commission is of the opinion that the surveillance of the Line between the crossing points conducted by the Republic of Cyprus and the Sovereign Base Area Administration needs substantial strengthening without delay . However , the Republic of Cyprus remains reluctant to take any measure which possibly could lead to the Line taking on the appearance of an external border . As regards goods crossing the Green Line , in comparison to the previous reporting period , reported figures show again an increase in the total value of goods crossing the Line . It should be noted , though , that almost 30 % accounted for trade in potatoes . In the current reporting period very few new products were introduced . Only in three cases , goods crossed the Line and were subsequently subject to an intra - community transaction with another Member State . However , several reported cases confirm that there are still many obstacles to the further development of Green Line trade . Turkish Cypriot commercial vehicles and in particular lorries and buses still can not move freely across the island since compromise solutions have been either rejected or delayed by one or the other community . In addition , Turkish Cypriot traders continued to report difficulties in stocking supermarkets and advertising their products and services in the press in the government - controlled areas .

Through a process that integrates economic and environmental objectives , is clearly oriented towards the needs of efficient freight and passenger services on a co - modal basis and involves innovation , future TEN - T policy should provide a sound basis for an effective contribution to the Community 's climate change objectives . All this justifies undertaking a fundamental review of TEN - T policy rather than just reviewing and possibly updating outline plans and priority projects .

L385	On the contrary , it is anticipated that , bearing in mind the way that this field is currently developing , it will have negative impacts in the sense of creating administrative difficulties stemming from numerous diverging systems , increased costs of compliance with such diverging systems and distorting competition . The legislative proposal policy option possesses the clear advantage of increasing security in the form of reducing the risk of terrorist attacks and of organised crime being committed on the territory of the EU . It presents further advantages in the form of preventing the distortion of competition by imposing the same requirements for all carriers which operate flights to and from the EU . The costs for the carriers and the administrative setup would ultimately be much less than when Member States develop their own systems . The convenience to passengers would increase , by reducing the time required for border control . Between the " no action " policy and the legislative proposal policy , the legislative proposal presents clear advantages . Between the two options for a legislative proposal , the option of a decentralised collection of data presents advantages over the centralised option in relation to the increase to the security of the EU .

Article 10 clarifies the arrangements for Proxy voting and abolishes the arrangements whereby certain companies impose restrictions as to the person who can be granted a Proxy . The option of doing nothing , in other words to leave the present situation as it is does not recommend itself to the EESC . The obstacles make cross - border voting prohibitively expensive for small shareholders and very costly for institutional investors . Conclusions and recommendations The Committee confirms and reiterates the points it made previously in its opinion ( 1 ) on the Green Paper on online gambling in the internal market ( 2 ) and regrets that the Commission has taken only some of its conclusions on board . In particular , it points out that stamping out illegal gambling , which is the primary threat in terms of consumer protection , is not the priority of the communication . Among the priorities that the communication is seeking to address , the Committee calls on the Commission to give consideration to the creation of new jobs and the preservation of existing ones in the sector , their quality and the potential loss of jobs in the land based gambling sector to online gambling .
L392	In this respect , it reiterates its request that the Commission conduct a research and monitoring exercise throughout the EU on online gambling - related addiction and illness , and recommends that Member States use some of the tax revenue generated to finance awareness - raising campaigns , preventive measures and treatments for gambling - related disorders . The Committee welcomes the Commission 's decision to improve administrative cooperation and the pooling of information , experience and best practice among Member States and regulators . The Committee welcomes the Commission 's objective that each Member State have its own regulatory authority with specific competences , to cooperate closely with their counterparts in other Member States . While supporting the initiatives proposed by the Commission for effective cooperation between Member States , the Committee would like to see more effective legislative instruments - preferably directives - being used in certain areas , where there is concurrent competence , to protect consumers and the most vulnerable groups , and to combat illegal operators and money laundering . This would establish a minimum set of consumer protection standards . Member States must retain the right to choose whether to establish higher standards of consumer protection for their national markets , or continue to apply the more favourable standards that are already in place ( 3 ) .

ENVIRONMENT POLICY AND BETTER REGULATION Highlights Using better regulation for better implementation and environmental results Environment policy has already delivered good environmental results , but more effective and easier implementation will make them even better . An important aspect of better regulation is to ensure that the administrative requirements to provide information imposed in legislation are proportionate to what is necessary for proper enforcement . Therefore , the Commission continues to apply better regulation principles in EU environmental policy - making , aiming to improve the design of existing and future legislation . Simplification In 2006 the Commission continued reviewing legislation such as the RoHS , WEEE and IPPC ( Integrated Pollution and Prevention Control ) Directives as part of the Simplification Rolling Programme .

L398	There were also regional committees in all the Austrian Länder . In the last few years there has been a trend towards buying meat in large supermarkets and discount stores . The EESC stresses , however , the importance of small - scale businesses , which can not be measured purely in terms of sales figures ( 4 ) . There are a large number of small firms in the dairy sector too . Unfortunately no European data are available on this . In the context of Agenda 2000 , both the European Commission and EU Member States stressed the need not only to enhance the competitiveness of EU agriculture on the world market but also to focus on quality . This strategy of increasing added value in rural areas is indissolubly linked to the maintenance and further development of the downstream sector of food processing . Small food businesses , and in particular , small artisanal food processors , are of strategic importance in connection with this quality policy . These small food businesses are the very businesses which can help to promote diversity by , for example , providing consumers with a high level of product diversity . Growing demand in this sector points to the fact that consumers are increasingly valuing such diversity and underlines the fact that traditional artisanal production methods are indissolubly linked to high product quality . These production methods are also part of our cultural heritage .
L399	III.4 . Establishment of affiliation , including adoption This area is governed by the Portuguese Civil Code . Normally , in this sphere the personal law of the parties involved will apply . The establishment of affiliation is governed by the personal law of the parent at the time the relationship is established . For this purpose , the crucial point in time is the birth of the child or the time the marriage was dissolved if this takes place earlier . Relationships between parents and children are governed by the common national law of the parents , failing which they are subject to the law of their habitual joint residence ; if the parents normally reside in different countries , the personal law of the child will apply . If affiliation is only deemed to have been established with one of the parents , that parent 's personal law will apply ; if one of the parents has died , the personal law of the survivor will apply . If there is no habitual joint residence either , the law of the country with which the family life of the adoptive parents is deemed most closely connected will apply . There must also be compliance with any requirement for the consent of a third party to whom the person concerned is linked by any relationship of family or guardianship , where this accords with the law governing that party .
L400	However , the Hague Convention concerning Powers of the Authorities and the Law Applicable in Respect of the Protection of Minors ( of 5 October 1961 ) - which applies whenever the habitual residence of the minor is in a State which is a signatory of the Convention - makes paternal authority subject to the law of the minor 's nationality . Additionally , the Munich convention on the Law Applicable to Surnames and Forenames makes the effects of affiliation on the child 's name subject to the law of the child 's nationality The obligation to provide maintenance for the child is , in turn , governed by the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Maintenance Obligations in Respect of Children ( of 24 October 1956 ) and by the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Maintenance Obligations ( of 2 October 1973 ) - the latter replacing the former in respect of relationships between States bound by that convention . I want you to keep that . I 'll hold it for you . I 'll tell you , " Do n't ever write me . I 'll tell you , " I believe in God 's Kingdom , " and I believe I 'll be with you again and your mother , but not in this lifetime .

L406	In the Community there is a need for improved energy end - use efficiency , managed demand for energy and promotion of the production of renewable energy , as there is relatively limited scope for any other influence on energy supply and distribution conditions in the short to medium term , either through the building of new capacity or through the improvement of transmission and distribution . This Directive thus contributes to improved security of supply . Improved energy end - use efficiency will also contribute to the reduction of primary energy consumption , to the mitigation of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions and thereby to the prevention of dangerous climate change . These emissions continue to increase , making it more and more difficult to meet the Kyoto commitments . Human activities attributed to the energy sector cause as much as 78 % of the Community greenhouse gas emissions . The Sixth Community Environment Action Programme , laid down by Decision N o 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 4 ) , envisages that further reductions are required to achieve the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change long - term objective of stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system . Therefore , concrete policies and measures are necessary . Improved energy end - use efficiency will make it possible to exploit potential cost - effective energy savings in an economically efficient way .
L407	Energy efficiency improvement measures could realise these energy savings and thus help the Community reduce its dependence on energy imports . Furthermore , a move towards more energy - efficient technologies can boost the Community 's innovativeness and competitiveness as underlined in the Lisbon strategy . The Communication from the Commission on the implementation of the first phase of the European Climate Change Programme listed a directive on energy demand management as one of the priority climate change measures to be taken at Community level . This Directive is consistent with Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity ( 5 ) and with Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas ( 6 ) , which provide for the possibility of using energy efficiency and demand - side management as alternatives to new supply and for environmental protection , allowing Member State authorities , inter alia , to tender for new capacity or to opt for energy efficiency and demand - side measures , including systems for white certificates .

Court charges ( State dues , processing fees , costs associated with the investigation ) must be paid before submitting an application . This can be done at a bank . Where a claim is fully or partially successful or if the plaintiff retracts a claim because the defendant has settled the claim voluntarily after its submission , the court orders the defendant to pay the running costs of the case ( the costs of legal assistance , expenses relating to court appearances and gathering of evidence ) in favour of the plaintiff .

Although accepting in the present case that brief and even formulaic statements of reasons complied with Article 253 EC , it did not do so without first verifying whether the statement of reasons met the two basic criteria set out above , namely were they sufficient in order to enable the appellant to understand why access had been refused to the documents requested and did they permit the CFI to exercise judicial control ?

L423	Both the parties ' and the customers ' data on tender participation indicated that each of BSG and Syniverse faced strong competition from MACH . In nearly half of the cases there were only two bidders , but BSG and Syniverse were never the only two bidders in a tender . This means that the MNOs determined that the tender process was sufficiently competitive with two bidders , namely MACH and BSG or MACH and Syniverse . The analysis of the ranking data has shown that Syniverse and BSG were only very rarely both the winner and the runner - up in the same tender . The results of the analysis indicate that prices offered by BSG are unaffected by whether or not Syniverse participated in a tender , which also implies that Syniverse does not exert a strong competitive pressure on BSG 's prices . Costs incurred in switching can be offset by the savings made in switching suppliers . The Commission has found several instances of switching suppliers in Europe occurring between 2004 and 2007 . The market investigation has also shown that switching between BSG and Syniverse ( or vice versa ) is very rare . The characteristics of the market for data clearing services provide incentives for suppliers to compete intensely , which would make a unilateral price increase by the merged entity unlikely . Firstly , there are no capacity constraints .
L424	Secondly , the provision of data clearing services is characterised by low marginal costs for those suppliers providing these services on their own equipment . Suppliers therefore have a strong incentive to compete aggressively for every contract . First , such a decision would go far beyond the need to protect the right to privacy of telephone service users . Second , it would irreparably eliminate the right of subscribers to verify and monitor , through their bills , the cost of each call made by denying them access to data which are decisive for determining the cost of each call .

L446	Currently , where a taxable person intends to use for private purposes a vehicle on which he has deducted the input tax in full or in part on the purchase , he is required to account for output tax on that use . If one were to follow the argumentation of the Netherlands Government , it would be sufficient for any Member State to characterise a certain conduct as unlawful for that Member State to be authorised to refuse any application for establishment , even if the conduct itself was an application for establishment . It is the lawfulness of the Netherlands requirement that must first be assessed and not vice versa . In this case , contrary to the situation of the Bulgarian nationals , the nationals of the Associated States were in a lawful situation until they decided to apply for residence with a view to establishment . As a consequence of that application , not only are they unable to exercise the right of establishment through such an application but they are moreover also deprived of their right to a short stay under the Schengen regime . More Managing authority Monitoring Monitoring committee Mountain areas Managing authority Under the auspices of the EU 's Cohesion Policy for 2007 - 13 , a managing authority is responsible for the efficient management and implementation of an Operational Programme . More Monitoring EU Structural and Cohesion funding must be spent effectively and in accordance with its defined purpose .
L447	More Monitoring committee Member States are required to appoint monitoring committees to check that Operational Programmes ( OPs ) which use Structural and Cohesion funding are being correctly implemented . These committees are chaired by the relevant Member State ( or managing authority ) and comprise regional , economic and social partners . More Mountain areas A 2004 study for the European Commission showed that the European Union , Norway and Switzerland contain mountain - area municipalities which cover some 1 900 000 km2 ( about 40.6 per cent of total land mass ) . More N+2 , n+3 NUTS National Strategic Reference Framework ( NSRF ) N+2 , n+3 N+2 and n+3 relate to financing rules for the annual allocation of money from the European Union 's Structural and Cohesion Funds . Automatic decommitments are made if funding is not spent , or requests for payments are not made , by the end of the second year ( n+2 ) . This deadline is extended to three years ( n+3 ) for the new Member States plus Greece and Portugal until 2010 . NUTS levels are geographical areas used to collect harmonised data in the EU . They have been used in the Structural Funds since 1988 and play an important role in allocating Structural Funds .

L449	The Treasury , as a prudent borrower in a market economy , should have taken this very important aspect into account . In addition , the variations in the amounts deposited with the Treasury in the years 1995 - 2005 , as a consequence of the legal changes , should also have induced a private borrower to take the five - year average life identified by the prudential model referred to above as an upper bound for the purpose of setting its own rate offering . Therefore , in the context of passive management of the funds , the Commission considers that in view of the strengthening of PI 's financial autonomy ( with the risk of changes in the law , leading to a significant reduction in the amount deposited with the Treasury or private borrower ) , a five - year maturity would have been regarded by a private borrower , when the Agreement was negotiated , as a maximum maturity for the purpose of setting its own offering . Italy considers that , in the specific context of the active management of PI 's liquidity ( which has become a reality from 2007 onward ) , the [ ... ] model supports PI 's choice of optimal asset allocation and the trade - off between risk and return .

L454	The technique by which Zala / Kira had been formed remained a mystery . The medics here had poked and probed and found nothing . Her brain , aside from the Warden organisms ' odd grouping , appeared normal . And yet it was not a psych technique , or some mental aberration - the wa showed clearly a true biological division there somewhere . To look into a mirror , to see such a personality - the perfect assassin - and see in all its ugliness the perfection of those qualities you always prided yourself on , this was the problem . Charon and its viewpoints and my own experiences here had killed that certainty , and even though I was still , for now , on the same side , I was there because the opposition repelled me , not out of any lingering loyalty to the Confederacy ideal . Explaining all this to Darva was n't easy . She had n't been raised to believe . I had been a believer who lost his faith but found his humanity . While ongoing for weeks or months , these events have not yet produced their full disruptive impact on the global economy . It is not often that the world finds itself facing the stagflationary risk of lower demand and lower supply at the same time . And it is even more unusual to have two distinct developments leading to such an outcome .
L455	The Middle Eastern uprisings have pushed oil prices higher , eating up consumer purchasing power while raising input prices for many producers . At the same time , Japan 's trifecta of calamities - the massive earthquake , devastating tsunami , and paralyzing nuclear disaster - have gutted consumer confidence and disrupted cross - border production chains ( especially in technology and car factories ) . The second big global risk comes from Europe , where Germany 's strong performance is coinciding with a debt crisis on the European Union 's periphery . Last week , Portugal joined Greece and Ireland in seeking an official bailout to avoid a default that would undermine Europe 's banking system . Yet , despite the tremendous social pain , this approach will make no dent in their large and rising debt overhang . Meanwhile , housing in the United States is weakening again - the third large global risk . Indeed , in some areas , prices are again under downward pressure , which could worsen if mortgage finance becomes less readily available and more expensive , as is possible . It will also make relocating even more difficult for Americans in certain parts of the country , aggravating the long - term - unemployment problem . ' Uh . . . do you shun publicity ?

As far as the Netherlands' ability to estimate the population targeted by ESL actions is concerned , the situation mentioned by the Court has now been remedied through the use of a national database . In several of the Member States mentioned , quantified national targets have been set to reduce early school leaving in line with the European target . In the medium and long term , the number of early school leavers should drop in response to these measures . This is confirmed by the 2000 to 2004 trend as reported in the Communication on modernising education and training ( COM(2005 ) 549 ) . The distribution of funds between the various regions of a Member State or between the different measures is a national responsibility .
L457	The Commission welcomes the good practice mentioned by the Court in the cases of Ireland and the UK in establishing consortia of schools operating under written agreements to improve the efficiency of project and programme administration . In many of the cases mentioned , objective criteria are now used for the selection of beneficiaries . Frameworks such as the standard protocols and assessment matrices used in the Netherlands also ensure proper project selection . Measures have been put in place for the two Member States concerned ( Ireland and the Netherlands ) to improve the coordination of measures and the dissemination of research findings . Mid - term reviews have referred to the specific measures designed to combat early school leaving in the Member States audited . This Directive shall not affect the right of Member States to adopt or retain more favourable provisions for persons to whom it applies . Any research organisation wishing to host a researcher under the admission procedure laid down in this Directive shall first be approved for that purpose by the Member State concerned . " No , " Christine said . She turned away from the window , went to him , sat on the edge of his bed . He was still pale . Shaking . The duration of such measures must not exceed six months .
L458	However , the selection of pre - existing documents that are submitted to a competition authority for the purposes of the proceedings is in itself relevant , as undertakings are invited to supply targeted evidence in view of their cooperation . The willingness of undertakings to supply such evidence exhaustively or selectively when cooperating with competition authorities may be hindered by disclosure requests that identify a category of documents by reference to their presence in the file of a competition authority rather than their type , nature or object ( e.g. requests for all documents in the file of a competition authority or all documents submitted thereto by a party ) . Therefore , such global disclosure requests for documents should normally be deemed by the court as disproportionate and not complying with the requesting party 's duty to specify categories of evidence as precisely and narrowly as possible . ( e ) Finally , to prevent documents obtained through access to a competition authority 's file becoming an object of trade , only the person who obtained access to the file ( or his legal successor in the rights related to the claim ) should be able to use those documents as evidence in an action for damages .

EN No carcinogenicity studies in animals have been conducted with deferiprone . The genotoxic potential of deferiprone was evaluated in a set of in vitro and in vivo tests .

The updated description of this method and the experimental values for the validation parameters for the method should also be included in Chapter 3 of the Annex to that Regulation . Regulation ( EEC ) No 2676/90 should therefore be amended accordingly .

Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union . Done at Brussels , 28 February 2005 . The Finanzgericht Düsseldorf has therefore asked the Court for a preliminary ruling on the question : ' Is [ the contested regulation ] valid?' Case C-147/10 British Sugar 48 . It claims , first , that the contested regulation has the same fundamental defect as Regulations Nos 1762/2003 , 1775/2004 and 1686/2005 . The method of calculation , in particular as regards the ' average loss per tonne' , is based on hypothetical losses reflecting export refunds which were notionally available but never actually paid . The ' overall loss' is therefore inflated . Second , the contested regulation is invalid in so far as it requires non - euro repayments to be made at the exchange rates applicable at the time the levy was originally calculated rather than the time of repayment .

In particular , summonses must be served on defendants . The purpose of service is to ensure that the defendant is able to take cognisance of the complainant 's claim and the grounds for it . Apart from this , documents are served only in particular cases as stipulated by law . For example , a creditor 's demand that a debtor be declared bankrupt must be served on the debtor . Judgments and decisions on civil cases are not served .

Otherwise , undertakings could easily evade the application of the rules on limitation by corporate restructuring . Article 81 EC and the rules on limitation laid down in Article 25 of Regulation No 1/2003 apply to undertakings and not to the legal entities of which they are composed . It follows that if legal persons which form part of the Akzo undertaking participate in an infringement , the limitation period begins to run only on the day on which the infringements committed by the Akzo undertaking cease . 116 The Commission observes that the first investigative actions were taken in January and February 2003 , thereby restarting the five - year limitation period , and that further investigative actions were taken subsequently , so that the first contested decision was adopted well within five years of the most recent investigative action .

There was silence . " I repeat my request , " said Gendibal . " Anyone ? " Gendibal said , " First Speaker , you now have the motive for delaying me . " The First Speaker said , " State it explicitly . " " You have expressed the need to deal with Trevize , with this First Foundationer . It represents an important initiative in policy and if the Speakers had read my treatment , they would have known in a general way what was in the wind . If , nevertheless , they had unanimously disagreed with you - unanimously - then , by traditional self - limitation , you would have been unable to go forward . If even one Speaker backed you , then you would be able to implement this new policy .
L507	I agree with him and he can , in accordance with tradition , disregard the disagreement of the ten other Speakers . " Delarmi struck the table with her fist .

Furthermore , a copy of the petition is served on the prosecutor , and a summary is published in two newspapers , one of which is published in Athens and the other in the district of the court where the case is to be tried , if the respondent 's address is not known . A counterclaim is made in the same court by lodging an application and serving the counter respondent five working days before the trial date . After some time the court delivers its judgment deciding how parental responsibility is to be exercised . Which procedure applies in these cases ? Contracts of long duration can lead to the closing of the market for a longer period than is necessary , thus diminishing the benefits of competitive pressure . To minimise distortion of competition while protecting quality of services , public service contracts should in principle be of limited duration .

Sampling One exporting producer claimed that the selection of the sample was unfair since it was merely based on export volumes considerations , and that it should have been included in the sample considering the high added value of the products it exported to the Community . This claim was , however , rejected since the selection of the companies included in the sample was done in conformity with Article 17(1 ) of the basic Regulation , i.e. on the basis of the largest representative volume of exports that could reasonably be investigated within the time available . Another exporting producer contested the conclusions that , since it had explicitly refused to be included in the sample , it could not be considered a cooperating party . The company firstly claimed that pursuant to Article 17(2 ) of the basic Regulation the selection of the sample must be made with the consent of the parties , thus leaving them the possibility not to be part of the sample . Secondly , it claimed that according to Article 2(7 ) of the basic Regulation , a verification visit is not a necessary condition for demonstrating that a company fulfils the five relevant criteria , so that it could still be granted MET .
L512	Concerning the first claim , it is noted that according to Article 17(2 ) of the basic Regulation , the consent of the parties is not a necessary condition , since that Article provides that the final selection rests with the Commission and that only preference shall be given to choosing a sample in consultation with , and with the consent of the parties concerned . Furthermore , the selection of the sample in this case was made in consultation with the Chinese authorities and , during this process , the company concerned again expressed that it did not wish to be included in the sample , namely on the grounds that it would have difficulties to receive a verification visit . Finally , it is also noted that the company did not ask for an individual examination , pursuant to Article 17(3 ) of the basic Regulation . The second claim was considered unfounded since , pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation , the refusal to provide access to the necessary information , thus also with respect to MET determination , should be considered as non - cooperation . It was made clear to the company that the inclusion in the sample implied replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on - the - spot verification of their response , which was refused by the company .

L517	ELHASSAN held this position as Western Military Area Commander from November 2004 ( approx . ) - early 2006 . The Panel 's information is that ELHASSAN was responsible for violations of paragraph 7 of SCR 1591 as by virtue of this position he requested ( from Khartoum ) and authorized ( since 29 March 2005 ) the transfer of military equipment into Darfur without the prior approval of the 1591 Committee . ELHASSAN himself admitted to the Panel of Experts that aircraft , aircraft engines and other military equipment had been brought into Darfur from other parts of Sudan between 29 March 2005 and December 2005 . For example he informed the Panel that 2 Mi-24 attack helicopters were brought unauthorized into Darfur between 18 and 21 September 2005 . There are also reasonable grounds to believe that ELHASSAN was directly responsible , as Western Military Area Commander , for authorizing offensive military flights in the area around Abu Hamra , 23 - 24 July 2005 and in the Jebel Moon area of Western Darfur , on 19 November 2005 .

L526	For the Union to incur non - contractual liability within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 288 EC , a series of conditions must be met , namely the conduct of which the institutions are accused must have been unlawful , the damage must be real and a causal connection must exist between that conduct and the damage in question .

SVR after treatment of chronic HCV with non - pegylated interferon alfa-2b with ribavirin results in long - term clearance of the virus providing resolution of the hepatic infection and clinical ' cure ' from Medicinal product no longer authorised 22 chronic HCV .

L527	5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Ribavirin is absorbed rapidly following oral administration of a single dose ( mean Tmax= 1.5 hours ) , followed by rapid distribution and prolonged elimination phases ( single dose half - lives of absorption , distribution and elimination are 0.05 , 3.73 and 79 hours , respectively ) . Absorption is extensive with approximately 10 % of a radiolabelled dose excreted in the faeces . However , absolute bioavailability is approximately 45 % -65 % , which appears to be due to first pass metabolism . There is a linear relationship between dose and AUCtf following single doses of 200 - 1,200 mg ribavirin . Ribavirin does not bind to plasma proteins . Ribavirin transport in non - plasma compartments has been most extensively studied in red cells , and has been identified to be primarily via an es - type equilibrative nucleoside transporter . This type of transporter is present on virtually all cell types and may account for the high volume of distribution of ribavirin . The ratio of whole blood : plasma ribavirin concentrations is approximately 60:1 ; the excess of ribavirin in whole blood exists as ribavirin nucleotides sequestered in erythrocytes . What Bronchitol contains : Each capsule contains 40 milligrams mannitol . Average inhaled dose per capsule is 32.2 milligrams mannitol . What Bronchitol looks like and contents of the pack : Bronchitol is a powder for inhalation that is filled into capsules .

The main messages from stakeholders included strong support for the EU 's main quality schemes ( geographical indications and organic farming ) and marketing standards , but also called for simplification and streamlining . Farmers , producers and consumers urged greater use of place of farming labelling . On the other hand , processors and retailers warned that it can be difficult to track the farming origins of ingredients in processed foodstuffs . For all schemes - EU , private and national - defence of the single market and simplification were also strong messages . Some stakeholders , especially processors , warned against developing incoherent schemes that could cause confusion in the marketplace .

L549	EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM Natura 2000 areas The Voordelta is home to flora and fauna of special ecological value . This is why this area has been designated a Natura 2000 area under the auspices of the EU Birds and Habitats Directive . The Netherlands is obliged to establish and maintain a ' favourable conservation status' for certain species and their habitats . Wildlife conservation is legally regulated under the Flora and Fauna Act , and conservation areas are legally regulated under the Nature Conservation Act 1998 . The Nature Conservation Act 1998 requires that a management plan be established for all Natura 2000 areas . Flora and fauna of special ecological value can be found throughout the whole of the Voordelta ; however , the greatest diversity is located in the northern half of the area . Conservation measures are therefore most effective when applied to these northern areas . Maasvlakte 2 Compensation Report Development of Maasvlakte 2 in the Voordelta Natura 2000 area will result in the loss of flora and fauna of ecological value partly due to a reduction of the Natura 2000 area 's size by 2 455 hectares . The key spatial planning decision ( hereinafter KSPD ) , Main Port Rotterdam Development 2006 , stipulated that this loss be compensated for by establishing a conservation area elsewhere in the Voordelta , where usage restrictions could be imposed . The KSPD also stated that usage restrictions and other measures would help improve the ecological value of the conservation area .

What kind of assistance can the petitioner receive from this organisation or government department ( central or local ) ? What if the petitioner is in another country and the maintenance debtor is in Italy ?
L558	What kind of assistance can the petitioner receive from this organisation or government department ( central or local ) ? What do the concepts " alimenti " and " obbligazione alimentare " cover according to the law of Italy ? Italian law defines " alimenti " as the legally - enforced provision of material assistance to a person or persons in financial need , even if they are in such a situation through their own fault ( Article 433 et seq . of the Civil Code ) . The duty to provide maintenance falls within the duties of family solidarity , despite the fact that family maintenance responsibilities are becoming less and less important as the concept of a cohesive society which itself should address all our essential material needs begins to take hold . Those liable to provide maintenance are given in order below : the spouse , in cases where there is no duty to provide " mantenimento " , i.e. spouses separated through fault and spouses who have received the money awarded in the divorce settlement ; children , including adopted children , or in their absence , direct relatives in the descending line ; parents , or in their absence , direct relatives in the ascending line ; adoptive parents ; sons - in - law and daughters - in - law ; fathers - in - law and mothers - in - law ; full brothers and sisters ; half - brothers and half - sisters ;
L559	The closest relative according to the above ranking is liable to provide maintenance ; should there be more than one person at the same level , liability is divided between them according to their financial situations . Other cases : recipients must provide maintenance for themselves before they receive maintenance from any other liable persons ; where no other persons are liable , maintenance must also be provided by the spouse responsible for the annulment of the marriage to the spouse not at fault ; maintenance must also be provided by parents to unacknowledged children who have reached majority and are in need . ( e ) facilitating the access to the network , in particular removing barriers that could prevent access for new market entrants and renewable energies ; ( f ) ensuring that network operators are granted adequate incentives , in both the short and the long term , to increase efficiencies in network performance and foster market integration ; ( h ) contributing towards high standards of public service for natural gas and the protection of vulnerable customers , and helping to ensure that consumer protection measures set out in Annex A are effective ; ( i ) harmonising necessary data exchange processes .

Ability of Community producers to supply the Community market A number of parties commented on the low level of the Spanish production , which they claimed is unable to fully supply the community market . While it is correct to state that in the present situation the Community industry does not supply the overall EU market , it should be noted that this fact is linked to the effect of injurious imports , as explained above . In any event , the intended effect of the measures is not to close the Community market to Chinese imports , but to remove the effects of injurious dumping . Given , inter alia , the existence of only two sources of supply of these products , it is considered that in the event definitive measures are imposed , Chinese products would continue to enjoy a significant demand in the Community .

L587	The Commission has therefore put in place measures to ensure that interest earned regularly reflects market interest rates , as well as their possible fluctuation . Accounts opened with Member States Treasuries or National Central Banks for own resources receipts are non - interest bearing and free of charges . Overnight balances held on commercial bank accounts earn interest on a daily basis . This is based on variable market rates to which a contractual margin ( positive or negative ) is applied . For most of the accounts the interest calculation is linked to the ECB marginal rate for its main refinancing operations , and is adjusted to reflect any fluctuations of this rate . As a result no risk exists that the Commission earns interest at rates lower than market rates . Um ... well , I think that the ghostis a figment of Macbeth 's imagination .

L598	68 The Commission points out that the contested decision clearly states that it consulted the German authorities and that they requested it not to disclose their correspondence . It argues that , as a result , pursuant to Article 4(5 ) of the Regulation , it was not in a position to disclose that correspondence . 69 The Commission maintains that , in view of the above discussion as regards the first plea , that reasoning was complete and described the reason for the refusal of access . It maintains that this statement of reasons is consistent with the approach adopted by the acting Director - General of DG ' Environment' in his fax of 13 February 2002 ( see paragraph 15 above ) . Insolvency of members of a group of companies The proposal creates a specific legal framework to deal with the insolvency of members of a group of companies while maintaining the entity - by - entity approach which underlies the current Insolvency Regulation . The proposal introduces an obligation to coordinate insolvency proceedings relating to different members of the same group of companies by obliging the liquidators and the courts involved to cooperate with each other in a similar way as this is proposed in the context of main and secondary proceedings . Such cooperation could take different forms depending on the circumstances of the case . Liquidators should notably exchange relevant information and cooperate in the elaboration of a rescue or reorganisation plan where this is appropriate .
L599	Courts should cooperate , in particular , by exchanging information , coordinating , where appropriate , the appointment of liquidators which can cooperate with each other , and approving protocols put before them by the liquidators . In addition , the proposal gives each liquidator standing in the proceedings concerning another member of the same group . In particular , the liquidator has a right to be heard in these other proceedings , to request a stay of the other proceedings and to propose a reorganisation plan in a way which would enable the respective creditors ' committee or court to take a decision on it . The liquidator also has the right to attend the meeting of creditors . These procedural tools enable the liquidator which has the biggest interest in the successful restructuring of all companies concerned to officially submit his reorganisation plan in the proceedings concerning a group member , even if the liquidator in these proceedings is unwilling to cooperate or is opposed to the plan . In providing for the coordination of different proceedings relating to members of the same group , the proposal does not intend to prevent the existing practice in relation to highly integrated groups of companies to determine that the centre of main interests of all members of the group is located in one and the same place and , consequently , to open proceedings only in a single jurisdiction .

Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Plasma protein binding Pramipexole is bound to plasma proteins to a very low ( < 20 % ) extent , and little biotransformation is seen in man . Therefore , interactions with other medicinal products affecting plasma protein binding or elimination by biotransformation are unlikely . As anticholinergics are mainly eliminated by biotransformation , the potential for an interaction is limited , although an interaction with anticholinergics has not been investigated . There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with selegiline and levodopa . Inhibitors / competitors of active renal elimination pathway Cimetidine reduced the renal clearance of pramipexole by approximately 34 % , presumably by inhibition of the cationic secretory transport system of the renal tubules . Therefore , medicinal products that are inhibitors of this active renal elimination pathway or are eliminated by this pathway , such as cimetidine , amantadine , mexiletine , zidovudine , cisplatin , quinine , and procainamide , may interact with pramipexole resulting in reduced clearance of pramipexole .

However , where there are good grounds for doing so , a bailiff may , at any stage of proceedings , place attached moveable assets under the supervision of a third party , who may be a creditor .

Clinical efficacy and safety Data from a multicenter open label randomized study support the use of docetaxel for the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node - positive breast cancer and KPS ≥ 80 % , between 18 and 70 years of age . After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes ( 1 - 3 , 4 + ) , 1491 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel 75 mg / m2 administered 1-hour after doxorubicin 50 mg / m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg / m2 ( TAC arm ) , or doxorubicin 50 mg / m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg / m2 and cyclosphosphamide 500 mg / m2 ( FAC arm ) . Both regimens were administered once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles .

L670	However , the investigation showed that although Eurostat data does not distinguish between wild and farmed salmon , the available information ( US and Canadian export statistics ) indicates that imports of wild salmon to the Community have in fact decreased since 2001 . Therefore , the inclusion of imports of all salmon in the Eurostat data did not cause the increase in imports observed in those data . One party also claimed that 2000 was an inappropriate base year for the analysis undertaken , claiming that salmon prices were unusually high in that year . However , the analysis focuses on the key developments in the most recent period , and changing the base year to 1999 or 2001 would not change the outcome of that analysis .

He was sixty - eight and had been a widower for a decade . His business cards described him as a news reporter , though in the parlance of journalism he was more realistically a stringer . Since small - town local news rarely had national or even area - wide significance , getting something published in a major newspaper or reported on radio or television was difficult , which was why no one ever made a fortune as a stringer and most - like Bert Fisher - barely scraped by . Still , Bert enjoyed what he was doing . During World War II , as an American G. I. in Europe he had worked for the armed forces newspaper , Stars and Stripes . It had put journalism in his bloodstream and ever since he had happily been a modest part of it .
L677	That was how Bert heard the Larchmont police transmission ordering an officer in car 423 to go to the Grand Union supermarket . It seemed like a routine call until , soon after , the officer alerted police headquarters to a possible kidnap . At the word " kidnap , " Bert sat up straight , locked the radio on the Larchmont police frequency , and reached for copy paper to make notes . By the time the transmission finished , Bert knew he must hurry to the scene of action . Wanted paperwork I did n't have . This has never happened before . Excuse me ?

However , they argued that the case of Cyprus Airways was one of particular hardship , which should justify a lower own contribution , in particular due to the economic and financial situation of the country and the Turkey overflight ban . They also pointed to the significant reduction of capacity .
L682	The Turkey overflight ban meant that Cyprus Airways had a disadvantage in operating to the Russian market , due to the additional flight time . Furthermore , they provided evidence that although passenger numbers in the Greek market dropped marginally since 2008 , the average fare of Greek flights ( including domestic flights ) dropped significantly . Finally , the Cypriot authorities justified the provision of training aid during 2010 - 11 by arguing that Cyprus Airways only entered in difficulties in late 2011 .

EUR - Lex - 52010PC0142 - EN 52010PC0142 Proposal for a Regulation ( EU ) of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation(EC ) No 732/2008 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011 / * COM/2010/0142 final - COD 2010/0140 * / [ pic ] | EUROPEAN COMMISSION | Brussels , 26.5.2010 COM(2010 ) 142 final 2010/0140 ( COD )
L685	The current scheme is established by Council Regulation ( EC ) No 732/2008 which will expire on 31 December 2011 . After this date operation of the GSP will lapse unless appropriate legislative action is taken to ensure continuity . The successor GSP Regulation should be based on a proposal from the Commission taking appropriately into account relevant considerations on the effectiveness of the current GSP in achieving its objectives and proposing such amendments as would ensure its continued effectiveness in the future . Internal work to prepare a Commission proposal on a successor Regulation started with a public consultation launched in March 2010 . It is expected that the Commission will be in a position to agree its proposal to the Council and Parliament in early 2011 . The length of the subsequent legislative procedure can not be predicted with certainty but it is likely to last at least 15 - 18 months . The remaining period of application of the GSP Regulation is therefore insufficient to permit the preparation of a Commission proposal for this purpose and subsequent agreement on a successor regulation through the ordinary legislative procedure . It is however desirable to ensure continuity in the operation of the scheme beyond 31 December 2011 . The consequences of any discontinuity in legal cover for GSP would be that all imports under GSP would revert to standard most favoured nation treatment , except for those from least developed countries which would be covered by the Everything But Arms ( EBA ) regime .
L686	Given prevailing uncertainties about the time it will take to complete the legislative process on a successor Regulation , it is proposed to extend the validity of the current GSP Regulation until 31 December 2013 .

What are the effects of enforcement measures ? What are the effects of enforcement on debtors who fail to comply ? May they continue to dispose of their property ? May penalties be imposed on them ? Enforcement procedures are based on conditions imposed on the debtor 's assets .
L688	Attachment is an order issued to the debtor to refrain from taking any action , from that moment on , with regard to the asset that may result in the removal of the asset from the procedure . In the case of immovable assets , the attachment is noted in the properties register , which makes the fact known to third parties . The bailiffs then consign the money , documentary credits and precious objects they have found to the Clerk of the Court . Any other items , most notably immovable assets , are entrusted to a custodian ( or , under certain conditions , to the debtor , for example , if the debtor lives in the property ) . In any event , the court responsible for enforcement gives the custodian or administrator of the assets suitable instructions pending the sale or assignment of the asset to the creditor . These instructions must be followed , and the custodian or administrator are liable under civil law ( for any damages ) and under criminal law , on the basis of various provisions in the Criminal Code , if items are removed , destroyed or allowed to deteriorate as a result of acts committed voluntarily or acts of negligence .

PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT The product concerned by this review is the same as the one in the original investigation and clarified by the product scope interim review , namely hand pallet trucks and their essential parts , i.e. chassis and hydraulics , originating in the PRC , currently falling within CN codes ex 8427 90 00 and ex 8431 20 00 . For the purpose of this Regulation , hand pallet trucks shall be trucks with wheels supporting lifting fork arms for handling pallets , designed to be manually pushed , pulled and steered , on smooth , level , hard surfaces , by a pedestrian operator using an articulated tiller .
L705	The hand pallet trucks are only designed to raise a load , by pumping the tiller , to a height sufficient for transporting and do not have any other additional functions or uses such as for example ( i ) to move and to lift the loads in order to place them higher or assist in storage of loads ( highlifters ) ; ( ii ) to stack one pallet above the other ( stackers ) ; ( iii ) to lift the load to a working level ( scissorlifts ) ; or ( iv ) to lift and to weigh the loads ( weighing trucks ) .

L707	123 It is also apparent from the documents analysed in paragraphs 114 to 121 above that the Lombard Club decisions were concerned above all with matters of principle and that they were prepared , in detail , by other committees . 124 The view of BAWAG and PSK , which seek to minimise the evidential value of those documents by claiming that the role of the Lombard Club was misperceived and overestimated by the participants in the other meetings , who were in general members of middle management , must also be rejected . Some of the documents analysed above were written by or addressed to general managers of certain banks who personally attended Lombard Club meetings and therefore were perfectly apprised of the role played by it . The Commission can not therefore be said to have exaggerated the evidential value of those documents . This is also confirmed by an internal CA memorandum produced by BAWAG and PSK as an annex to their applications , informing the addressees of the matters discussed at a committee meeting on deposit and lending business of 17 April 1996 . That memorandum envisages the preparation of a proposal that was first to be the subject of concertation within that committee and then to be discussed and , if necessary , decided upon within the Lombard Club . 126 It follows from the foregoing that the complaints concerning the classification of the committee meetings as a single overall cartel are unfounded .

L713	I what ? At their base swirled the toxic waters of the River Lethe , which had its origin in the Malg Swamp and meandered westward at the base of the great rock barrier to disappear into the impregnable vapors of the Kierlak Desert . Only a man driven by an unexplainable madness would have attempted to scale the Knife Edge . There was a passage through the barrier , a small , winding canyon that opened onto a series of craggy foothills which ran for several thousand yards to the base of a single , ominously solitary mountain just within the southern boundary of the ring . The scarred surface of this mountain was chipped and worn by time and the elements , lending the southern facing a singularly menacing appearance . In order to ensure appropriate minimum standards for such contracts and to ensure that the internal market and the common market organisation function well , some basic conditions for the use of such contracts should be laid down at Union level . All such basic conditions should , however , be freely negotiated . Nevertheless , in order to strengthen the stability of the dairy market and the outlet for milk producers in certain Member States where the use of extremely short contracts is quite widespread , Member States should be allowed to set a minimum contract duration to be included in such contracts and/or offers .
L714	Dairy cooperatives which have in their statutes or in the rules and decisions based thereon provisions with effects similar to those of the basic conditions for contracts laid down in this Regulation should , in the interests of simplicity , be exempted from a requirement that there be a written contract . In order to strengthen the effectiveness of the contract - based system set out above , where intermediate parties collect milk from farmers to deliver to processors , Member States should be given the possibility of applying that system also to those intermediaries . Article 42 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU ) provides that Union rules on competition are to apply to production of and trade in agricultural products only to the extent determined by the European Parliament and the Council within the framework of Article 43(2 ) TFEU , which itself provides for the establishment of the common organisation of agricultural markets . In order to ensure the viable development of production and thus to ensure a fair standard of living for dairy farmers , their bargaining power vis - à - vis dairy processors should be strengthened , thereby resulting in a fairer distribution of value added along the supply chain .
L715	Therefore , in order to realise these objectives of the common agricultural policy , a provision should be adopted pursuant to Article 42 and Article 43(2 ) TFEU to allow producer organisations constituted solely of dairy farmers or their associations to jointly negotiate contract terms , including price , for some or all of its members' production , with a dairy . However , only producer organisations which seek and obtain recognition under Article 122 of Regulation ( EC ) No 1234/2007 should be eligible to benefit from that provision . Furthermore , provision should be made for the possibility of de facto recognition under this Regulation for existing producer organisations recognised under national law . 21 In answer to a written question asked by the Court , the United Kingdom Government expressly acknowledged that ' [ t]he Order itself does not lay down an obligatory link between the employer 's right to deduct VAT in respect of fuel bought by the employee and the use of the fuel by the employee for the requirements of taxed operations of the employer' .

The ' annual single education allowance' is the amount equivalent to twelve ( 12 ) times the maximum monthly education allowances pursuant to Article 3(1 ) of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations as applicable at the beginning of the school year concerned . A ' month of enrolment' is any calendar month during the school year , during which the EU staff pupil concerned was enrolled in the Type II European School concerned .

L721	The Commission should have also referred to the tax rates and the depreciation periods for capital goods applicable to the steel industry throughout the common market or , at the very least , in the Member States where competitors of the applicant are established . Only that type of comparative examination of the tax rules applicable in the various Member States would have enabled it to ascertain whether the application of Paragraph 3 of the ZRFG gave the applicant an advantage of the same type with effects identical to a subsidy in the strict sense of the term . 78 The defendant submits that the basic conditions , in particular the infrastructures , vary from one Member State to another and that , as a rule , the higher the taxes , the better the basic conditions . In its view , this is why the Member State concerned is the appropriate reference point to take into account in examining the selective nature of the measure in question . It is therefore irrelevant to compare the rules applicable in the various Member States on the matter . Do what I say ... It 's okay , Davey , go ahead . But Hilly , I am scared .

L730	Can I watch ? Absolutely . I know this is a ridiculous question before I ask it , But you have n't , by any chance , kept up with your ... swordplay ? IMPACT OF DECREASED COMMUNITY INDUSTRY PRODUCTION AND ALLEGED DECREASE IN CONSUMPTION It has been argued by one interested party that the poor harvests of 2002 and 2003 and the decrease in production linked to the lack of raw material , i.e. fresh strawberries , in these years are a major contributing factor causing injury to Community industry . The decreased production and sales quantities were accompanied by a fall in prices whereas usually price increases are the consequence of poor harvests and less supply . In addition , an examination of the profitability of the Community industry over the period considered demonstrates that the industry continued to be profitable up to the year 2004 when there was a significant fall in prices of imports from the PRC . The possibility of a minor decrease in consumption in 2004 can therefore not be ruled out . Such a decrease would have had an effect on the sales volume of the Community industry . It 's the ocean .

It points out , however , that merely stating that we need to commit to continuing and deepening these efforts , even in connection with the five core policy directions outlined , is by no means sufficient to create the conditions for the necessary approaches at European , national , regional and local level ; fails to find in the Commission 's communication any description of the role of national , regional and local policies .

L736	The Commission also notes the undertaking given by the Italian authorities to transmit the final contracts with the banks ( containing these formal and unconditional subscription obligations ) to the Commission immediately after conclusion and before subscription of the new capital increase by the public authorities . A second undertaking given by the Italian authorities is to submit a report containing the actual subscription levels for this capital increase once the operation has been carried out . The Commission will pay the utmost attention to strict compliance with these undertakings by Italy so as to ascertain that the terms of the present decision will be properly adhered to . In this context , the Commission would stress the importance of Alitalia 's industrial plan for 2005 - 2008 ( including the revised version of April 2005 ) presented to the investors , which bases the future of the company on an initial ' recovery' phase in 2005 - 2006 prior to further development . The Commission would refer in this connection to the information already presented in the decision to initiate a procedure regarding this plan . The measures provided for in AZ Fly 's restructuring plan should result , from 2005 , in an increase of [ ... ] % of TKO ( tonne - kilometres offered ) together with an increase of [ ... ] percentage points in the load factor and [ ... ] % in the yield .
L737	In fact , over the first quarter of 2005 , the accounts for which were submitted on 12 May , the TKO increased by 13,9 % and the load factor already showed a 0,2 % increase . The turnover for the quarter shows an increase of 9 % , or € 77 million compared with 2004 , with an increase in costs of only € 36 million , or 5 % ; even operating costs have fallen if fuel costs , which have risen by € 45 million , are excluded ; the operating loss is therefore only € 120 million compared with € 190 million in 2004 . The average staffing levels for the quarter ( 19 075 members of staff ) have fallen by 1 617 , two - thirds being ground staff , thus implementing the restructuring measures negotiated with the trade unions . More generally , the plan provides for an annual improvement of around € 1 billion by 2008 , including € 200 million as a result of the load factor and some € 770 million from other aspects of the plan ; among the most significant improvements brought about by the latter are arise from savings on purchases , commercial expenses and staff expenses ( € ~ [ ... ] million per annum in each case ) .
L738	In this respect , consideration was given to publicly available information relating to major companies operating in the fertilizers business sector . It was found that the corresponding data from North American ( USA and Canadian ) producers would be the most appropriate for the purpose of the investigation , given the large availability of reliable and complete public financial information from listed companies in this region of the world . Therefore , SG&A costs and profit were established on the basis of the weighted average SG&A costs and profit from three North American producers , which were found to be amongst the largest companies in the nitrogen fertilizers ' sector , with regard to their domestic sales of the same general category of products ( nitrogen fertilizers ) . These three producers were considered to be representative of the nitrogen fertilizers ' business and their SG&A costs and profit thereby representative of those normally incurred by companies operating successfully in that business segment . It should be noted that the amount of SG&A costs and profit so established did not exceed the SG&A costs incurred and the profit realized by the Russian co - operating companies .

The petition is presented to the magistrate by the petitioner in person or by his / her lawyer ( especially sections 1253 c , 1254 and 1320 of the Judicial Code ) . If the applicant plans to bring the case to court , how does he / she know which court has jurisdiction ? The Justice of the Peace has general jurisdiction in disputes over maintenance allowances ( section 591(7 ) of the Judicial Code ) but there are exceptions . Proceedings taken by a child against the person who had relations with his mother during the legal conception period ( section 336 of the Civil Code ) come under the magistrates' court ( section 338 of the Civil Code ) . During divorce proceedings or separation proceedings on particular grounds , provisional measures relating to the individual , maintenance and spouses' and children 's possessions come under the jurisdiction of the President of the magistrates' court , who makes a summary judgement ( section 1280 of the Judicial Code ) . If there are no subsequent changes , the provisional measures taken for the children continue to apply after the divorce ( section 302 of the Civil Code ) .

In addition , the Commission fixed a multiplier of 2 owing to ExxonMobil 's high total turnover and the small percentage of the value of its sales on the markets affected by the cartel by comparison with that turnover , in order to ensure an appropriate deterrent effect , according to section 30 of the 2006 Guidelines .

End - use support , i.e. feed - in tariffs for the production of ' green energy' , is an important instrument for developing various kinds of bioenergy strategies at both local and regional level . Support for EU regional development should continue to be a key consideration in increasing the use of bioenergy .
L784	Energy production requires a large number of boilers and other high - value equipment that offer major growth potential . Increased use of wood energy would also open up major opportunities for exporting technology to markets outside the EU . Work on drawing up standards for sustainable biomass production is underway in connection with the EU framework directive on renewable energy . Standards are important for ensuring sustainable procurement and production of forest bioenergy and guaranteeing common procedures . Standards for sustainably produced forest biomass must be linked to the Europe - wide MCPFE criteria so as to avoid unnecessary work and duplication . Where 's your book ? Where is it ?

L787	Taking into account immigration by non - EU nationals , the EU 's population for 2020 is projected at 514 million , rising to 520 million in 2030 . This forecast is based on a hypothetical yearly net migration rate of slightly less than 1,5 million . In 2020 , therefore , population growth , including migration , is predicted to reach 14 million . Of these , 5,3 million will be in Spain , 4 million in the UK , 1,4 million in Italy , 1,3 million in France , nearly 1 million in Ireland , around 500 000 in Sweden and Belgium , and just under 500 000 in Portugal . Moreover , the number of 20 - 59 year - olds is set to decrease by 4,7 million . Thus , the forecast growth of the EU population will be due mainly to the over-65s , resulting in higher demographic ageing , with this age group comprising 20 % of the population . According to section 274 of the Code of Civil Procedure , litigation costs include : judicial stamp duties , judicial stamp , legal proceedings fees and proportional taxation , payment of specialists , reimbursement of witnesses , lawyers ' fees and any other expenses for which the winning party can produce evidence . Under our legislative system , stamp duties and lawyers ' and specialists ' fees are determined according to the complexity of the case and the value of the litigation object .
L788	Should there be several plaintiffs or defendants , they shall be equally forced to payment , proportionally or jointly . In criminal matters , the bearing of the litigation costs is regulated by the provisions of sections 189 - 193 from the Code of Criminal Procedure . The Code of Criminal Procedure distinguishes between the amounts due to witnesses , experts and interpreters , and payment of the litigation costs advanced by the state where the case results in a conviction and in other cases , which are dealt with on a case - by - case basis . Litigation costs incurred by the parties are borne by the defendant or by the injured party , depending on the court ruling on the facts of the case . Legal aid is part of the right of defence . Ensuring the right of defence is one of the basic rules of criminal procedure . Under section 6 , the Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates that the right of defence is guaranteed for the accused , the defendant and any other parties throughout the criminal proceedings and that any party has the right to be assisted by defence counsel throughout the proceedings . This provides for SMEs a reduction of 90 % in the fees for scientific advice , reduced fees for SMEs when applying for marketing authorisations and the provision of regulatory assistance for SMEs . Extensive use is already being made of these possibilities by SMEs active in this field .

Finally Drizzt chose a tactic that Tephanis could not counter , one that took the sprite 's advantage away . He slammed Tephanis into the wall , then tossed the stunned creature off the cliff .

It was , moreover , precisely because of her status as a Romanian national that the applicant applied for and was admitted to take part in the competition . 78 Furthermore , competition EPSO / AD/147/09 is clearly different from competition EPSO / AD/53/06 organised exclusively for Cypriot nationals , which the applicant relies on in support of her argument . Since one of the official languages of the Republic of Cyprus is Turkish , which is , however , not one of the official languages of the Union , it was necessary , as the Commission pointed out at the hearing , to make provision for an alternative language to Greek , which is the other official language of that Member State . The language chosen on that occasion was English , which was also one of the three languages that could be chosen for the second written test . In the circumstances in that case the Commission was obliged to organise general competitions under the conditions laid down by the Union legislature in Regulation No 401/2004 .
L805	By contrast , Regulation No 1760/2006 , on the basis of which competition EPSO / AD/147/09 at issue in the present case was held , does not contain any provision comparable to Article 2 of Regulation No 401/2004 . 79 In any event , even if the fact of sitting written test ( c ) in Romanian may have placed the applicant at a disadvantage compared with candidates who had Romanian as their mother tongue , it should be observed that differences in treatment which are justified on the basis of objective and reasonable criteria proportionate to the aim pursued by the treatment do not constitute a breach of the principle of equal treatment .

In its opinion , an affirmative answer would mean that use of a competitor 's trade mark in the context of comparative advertising does not fall within Article 5(1 ) of Directive 89/104 , because the trade mark is not being used there to indicate the origin of the advertiser 's goods .
L811	25 Second , it seeks to know , for the purposes of assessing the existence of a likelihood of confusion within the meaning of Article 5(1)(b ) of Directive 89/104 , whether consideration should be limited exclusively to a comparison between the trade mark and the disputed sign and between the goods or services for which the mark is registered and those for which the sign is used , or whether , on the other hand , it is appropriate to take account of the factual context in which the sign is used . 27 Thus , should the Court interpret Article 5(1 ) of Directive 89/104 to the effect that , in a case such as that in the main proceedings , that provision enables the proprietor of a registered mark to prohibit the use of his mark in comparative advertising , the referring court asks for an interpretation of Article 3a(1 ) of Directive 84/450 for the purposes of ascertaining whether , in order for a comparative advertisement in which a sign identical with , or similar to , a competitor 's mark is used to be permitted , use of that sign must be ' indispensable' to a comparison between the goods or services of the competitor and those of the advertiser . 28 It is in those circumstances that the Court of Appeal ( England and Wales ) ( Civil Division ) decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling :

However , the problem arises of a ' critical mass' of investment , capable of stemming the penetration of the European market by cultural products which inculcate patterns of behaviour and values that are alien to European culture .

In the latter regard , it is true that deductibility of input tax is an explicit condition only for the application of Article 5(6 ) or 6(2)(a ) , but I consider that it is necessarily implicit in Article 6(2)(b ) . It is not explicit there , essentially , because that provision refers principally to services supplied by staff , and staff costs ( in the form of salary ) do not bear VAT . However , where a complex supply falls to be classified as a supply of services , ( 17 ) the goods used will normally have been subject to VAT . And the taxable amount , for all supplies referred to in Article 6(2 ) , is ' the full cost to the taxable person of providing those services' ( Article 11A(1)(c ) ) . III.B. Research & Asset Management The Commission analysis showed that the merger raises competition concerns in the areas of broker reports , earning estimates , fundamentals , and economic time series . With regard to these four content sets , both Thomson and Reuters are the main suppliers on the market , with competitors unable to provide equivalent data in terms of depth ( history ) and breadth ( geographical coverage ) .
L830	In addition , the time and investments necessary for a competitor to build a comparable offer would be subsequent ( several years and millions of Euros ) , and in any case would not guarantee the same depth of data as some financial information are hardly available in the public space several years after their publication . In the supply of desktop solutions , Thomson and Reuters compete with competitors which may procure some of Thomson 's and Reuters ' content sets as input for their own desktop products . In this respect the distribution of desktop is vertically related to the provision of content sets . This vertical relationship may further increase the parties ' incentive to increase prices for the delivery of such databases to customers reached via competitors ' platform or to restrict the provision of these content sets to Thomson / Reuters own customers in order to induce customers to prefer the Thomson / Reuters package ( content and application tools ) instead of that of competitors .

In order to determine whether Íslenskt sement ehf . paid a price of the State 's shares below their market value , the Authority entrusted an independent expert with the assessment of the market value of Sementsverksmiðjan hf . at the time the sale took place . The independent expert assessed the market value of the company once the whole transaction was completed , taking into account the undertaking which continues operations . This means that the independent expert assessed the market value of Sementsverksmiðjan hf . after the National Treasury of Iceland had re - purchased some assets of the company which were not necessary for cement production ( 13 ) , and the Ministry of Finance had taken over pension - related liabilities of the company . In the opinion of the independent expert , the only method that can give an idea of what might be the fair value of the company in a transaction like the sale of the State 's shares in Sementsverksmiðjan hf . is the method of discounting estimated future cash flows ( value in use ) ( 14 ) . Cash - flow projections may therefore vary with the strategies of each individual investor .

L836	Furthermore , it also stresses that if we are to make the most effective use possible of the budgetary resources available , carbon capture and storage technologies , which are still very much at the developmental stage and are in themselves incapable of solving the problems of energy production or the security of supply , should not receive more funding than other technologies specialising in energy efficiency or renewable energy ; welcomes the proposal to chart a policy agenda for 2030 and a vision for 2050 . Real strategic orientations , investment decisions and infrastructure projects can only feasibly be contemplated over the longterm . The Committee expresses its surprise that the issue of decarbonising the EU electricity supply by 2050 appears to have been given priority over the other areas outlined in the 2050 vision , as suggested by the recommendation to tackle this issue as soon as the strategic plan for energy technologies has been established . While this topic is undoubtedly of importance and has much potential , there are numerous other issues which are equally , if not more , urgent .

When injecting a cord affecting a PIP joint of the fifth finger , the needle insertion must not be more than 2 to 3 mm in depth and not more than 4 mm distal to the palmar digital crease . Most patients experiencing tendon / ligament rupture or injury have gone on to have successful surgical repair . Early diagnosis and prompt evaluation and treatment are important because tendon rupture / ligament injury may potentially affect overall hand function .

Standard Policy Conditions The previous BER exempted the joint establishment and distribution of non - binding standard policy conditions ( SPCs ) for direct insurance ( 14 ) .
L859	However , whilst there is a need for comparability between insurance products for consumers , too much standardisation can be harmful for consumers and can lead to a lack of non - price competition . Accordingly , the Commission is planning to expand its Horizontal Guidelines to also address SPCs for all sectors . These are currently under review and it is planned to publish a draft of the revised Horizontal Guidelines for stakeholder consultation in the first half of 2010 . 4.2 . Security devices The previous BER exempted : ( i ) technical specifications , rules or codes of practice regarding security devices and procedures for assessing and approving their compliance with these standards as well as ( ii ) technical specifications , rules or codes of practice for the installation and maintenance of security devices and procedures for assessing and approving the compliance of undertakings which install or maintain security devices with such standards . However , the Commission considers that the setting of technical standards falls into the general domain of standard setting , which is not unique to the insurance sector . This is already the case , as point 6 of the Horizontal Guidelines provides guidance on the compliance of technical standards with Article 101 of the Treaty . Moreover , the Horizontal Guidelines are currently under review and it is planned to publish a draft of the revised Horizontal Guidelines for stakeholder consultation during the first half of 2010 .

L867	It is essential that the SC has full access to case files in order to safeguard OLAF 's independence by monitoring the efficiency and effectiveness of its investigatory procedures . Moreover , any additional legal obligation in the regulation could , at a later stage , give rise to judicial review .

It takes into account the interinstitutional discussions which have already taken place and aims to express the SC 's views on the main points of the RP . Based on an analysis of how the efficiency of investigations could be improved ( Part I ) , it will make proposals regarding the organisational aspects of OLAF ( Part II ) .

This is no longer needed because since March 2008 , as a result of the implementation of security - by - security data collection systems combined with the use of the Centralised Securities Database ( CSDB ) , the total euro area government debt held by non - euro area residents is published as part of the euro area international investment position . Guideline ECB/2004/15 of 16 July 2004 on the statistical reporting requirements of the European Central Bank in the field of balance of payments and international investment position statistics , and the international reserves template ( 2 ) provides for the data required for this statistic . Moreover , the envisaged further development of these security - by - security data collection systems and the CSDB should in due time enable additional details to be compiled on the holdings of government securities by country and sector . Therefore , since references to ' Debt held by non - residents inside the euro area' and ' Debt held by non - residents outside the euro area' are no longer necessary , they should be deleted from Annexes I and II to Guideline ECB/2005/5 to minimise the reporting burden . Annexes I and II are replaced by the Annexes to this Guideline . Annex IV is deleted . Article 2 This Guideline shall enter into force on 1 October 2008 .

As of the same date , equipment transmitting in the frequency band 5 600 - 5 650 MHz must also be able to detect pulse widths down to 0,8 μs and must perform a 10 min CAC ( Channel Availability Check ) or equivalent to take account of the fact that meteorological radars may perform receive - only noise calibration scans .

Notably , the data held by the Commission JRC relating to active substances under evaluation in the review programme shall be made available to ECHA , in accordance with the provision of Article 16 of the REACH Regulation . - Another important element of choice is that many of the ECHA scientific staff is already familiar with biocidal products , through previous work at the Commission JRC , in Member States Competent Authorities as well as in industry .
L951	For these reasons , it is felt that the ECHA , amongst the other options at hand - a new agency , the Commission JRC , the EMEA or EFSA - considered at an early stage of the process is the most effective one in terms of possible synergies . The legislative proposal therefore relies on the assumption that a number of tasks of a scientific and technical nature related to the assessment of active substances used in biocidal products and of certain biocidal products will be given to ECHA . To this end , financial resources are needed to ensure that ECHA has the appropriate level of staff and is able to convene as many meetings as necessary to deliver its opinions to the Commission .

The Union continues to seek the agreement of Iceland and the Faroe Islands to join Norway and the EU in the sustainable management of mackerel . This has not been forthcoming . The total of the TACs fixed by the EU , Norway , Faroe Islands and Iceland in 2013 was again 36 % above the scientific advice ( excluding Russian catches ) .

In Question 1 in Case C - 34/14 , the referring court expresses doubts about the validity of the regulation at issue given that it is based on Article 9(5 ) of the basic regulation . The referring court considers that that provision is incompatible with Articles 6.10 and 9.2 of the Anti - Dumping Agreement . Done at Brussels , 10 December 2010 .

L984	Article 2(5 ) of Directive 2000/78 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation must be interpreted as precluding a national measure , such as that at issue in the main proceedings , setting a maximum age for practising as a panel dentist , in this case 68 years , where the sole aim of that measure is to protect the health of patients against the decline in performance of those dentists after that age , since that age limit does not apply to non - panel dentists . Article 6(1 ) of Directive 2000/78 must be interpreted as not precluding such a measure where its aim is to share out employment opportunities among the generations in the profession of panel dentist , if , taking into account the situation in the labour market concerned , the measure is appropriate and necessary for achieving that aim . It is for the national court to identify the aim pursued by the measure laying down that age limit , by ascertaining the reason for maintaining the measure . ( see para . 78 , operative part 1 )
L985	2 . If national legislation setting a maximum age limit for panel doctors , having regard to its objective , were contrary to Directive 2000/78 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation , it would be for the national court hearing a dispute between an individual and an administrative body to decline to apply that legislation , even if it were prior to that directive and national law made no provision for disapplying it .

The obligation to state reasons is satisfied where the appointing authority states reasons for its decision rejecting a complaint against those decisions lodged under Article 90(2 ) of the Staff Regulations .
L1010	Consequently , it is enough to satisfy the obligation to state reasons that the reply to the complaint mentions how the conditions governing promotion laid down by law and the Staff Regulations have been applied in the official 's individual situation .

Annex VI Guidance on accounting for Direct Land Use Change emissions relevant for climate change This Annex gives guidance on the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions related to direct land use change contributing to climate change . The impact on climate is a result of biogenic CO 2 emissions and removals caused by carbon stock changes , and biogenic and non - biogenic CO 2 , N 2 O and CH 4 emissions ( e.g. biomass burning ) . Biogenic emissions include those resulting from the burning ( combustion ) or degradation of biogenic materials , wastewater treatment and biological sources in soil and water ( including CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O ) , while biogenic removals correspond to the uptake of CO 2 during photosynthesis . Non - biogenic emissions correspond to all emissions resulting from non - biogenic sources , such as fossil - based materials , while non - biogenic removals correspond to the CO 2 that is removed from atmosphere by a non - biogenic source ( WRI and WBCSD 2011b ) . Changes in land use might be classified as being direct or indirect :
L1012	Direct Land Use Changes ( dLUC ) occur as the result of a transformation from one land use type into another , which takes place in a unique land cover , possibly incurring changes in the carbon stock of that specific land , but not leading to a change in another system . Offshore operators need marine knowledge to assess and limit the environmental impact of any proposed activity . Although several Member States reported non - compliant samples , in general fewer samples exceeded the limit values ( and the limits of tolerance for the test methods ) compared to previous years . Several of the new EU10 Member States previously reported significant numbers of samples non - compliant with limit values , but the number of non - compliant samples they reported has reduced significantly in 2006 . Belgium reported a higher proportion ( ~3.5 % ) of non - compliant samples than other Member States in 2005 ( though improved on previous years ) , however insufficient detail has been provided in 2006 to gauge actual non - compliance numbers . Sulphur content for diesel was a particular problem in previous years ( mainly for EU-10 ) , due to the new mandatory < 50 ppm level from the start of 2005 . However , this problem appears to have been resolved in 2006 .
L1013	For the abatement of air pollution and the introduction of new engine technology it is important to note that the share of < 10 ppm and < 50 ppm sulphur fuels increased significantly from 2001 to 2006 for EU-15 . From 2005 , it was mandatory for all fuel to meet the < 50 ppm sulphur level , and for fuels of < 10 ppm sulphur to be introduced in all Member States .

L1015	The inside of this place was a maze , furnished with crude mirrors and dark lanterns flashing suddenly , constructed of confusingly painted walls all odd shapes and angles . The head of a real dragon , long since stuffed and varnished , popped out at Mark from behind a suddenly open panel . . Now another panel opened unexpectedly when he leaned on it , and he spun in confusion through a dark opening . A mirror showed him a distorted image of the chunky dandy , coming after him , perhaps still two mirrors away . A new figure loomed before Mark , that of a tall , powerful clown in jester 's motley .

L1016	Even in the dim starlight every movement was terribly piain as he inched forward agonisingly on chest and belly , dragging his shattered leg behind him . He was placing his hands beneath his shoulders , levering himself upward and forward while his head dropped below his shoulders with pain and the exhaustion of the effort , lowering himself slowly on the soft and sodden snow , then repeating the same heart - sapping process over and over again . Exbausted and pain - filled as the boy might be , Mallory thought , his mind was still working : he bad a white sheet over his shoulders and back as camouflage against the snow , and he carried a climbing spike in his right hand . He must have heard at least some of Tuizig 's conversation : there were two or three guns in the cave , he could easily have shot the guard without coming out at all -- but he must have known that the sound of a shot would have brought the Germans running , bad them back at the cave long before he could have crawled across the gully , far less cut loose any of his Mends .
L1017	He 's bound to hear him if he comes any closer , Mallory thought desperately , even in that soft snow he 's bound to hear him .

If any of the proceedings relate to two or more minors who are children of the same parents and resident in different districts , the court competent for the place of residence of the greatest number of such minors has jurisdiction . All other things being equal , the court in which the maintenance was requested in the first instance has jurisdiction . If , when the proceedings are started , the minor does not live in Portugal , the court competent for the place of residence of the applicant or respondent has jurisdiction . If the latter also lives abroad and the Portuguese court has jurisdiction internationally , the Lisbon court hears the case .
L1021	Does the applicant have to go through an intermediary to bring the case to court ( e.g. a lawyer , specific organisation or government department ( central or local ) etc . ) ? This is a simple application which does not need to be set out in the form of pleadings , in which the parties are identified , the facts described and the evidence presented ( particularly the list of witnesses ) . The application must be accompanied by a certificate issued by the registry office which proves the degree of consanguinity between the applicant and the respondent . In the case of an application for a change in the maintenance assessed previously , a certificate of the decision previously assessing the maintenance must also be attached . If the applicant can not submit these certificates owing to a lack of means , the court itself may request these from the competent bodies . The following means of proof exist : 21 Indeed , the importance of such a provision led the framers of the Treaty to provide expressly , in Article 85(2 ) of the Treaty , that any agreements or decisions prohibited pursuant to that article are to be automatically void ( judgment in Eco Swiss , cited above , paragraph 36 ) .
L1022	22 That principle of automatic nullity can be relied on by anyone , and the courts are bound by it once the conditions for the application of Article 85(1 ) are met and so long as the agreement concerned does not justify the grant of an exemption under Article 85(3 ) of the Treaty ( on the latter point , see inter alia Case 10/69 Portelange [ 1969 ] ECR 309 , paragraph 10 ) . Since the nullity referred to in Article 85(2 ) is absolute , an agreement which is null and void by virtue of this provision has no effect as between the contracting parties and can not be set up against third parties ( see the judgment in Case 22/71 Béguelin [ 1971 ] ECR 949 , paragraph 29 ) . 23 Thirdly , it should be borne in mind that the Court has held that Article 85(1 ) of the Treaty and Article 86 of the EC Treaty ( now Article 82 EC ) produce direct effects in relations between individuals and create rights for the individuals concerned which the national courts must safeguard ( judgments in Case 127/73 BRT and SABAM [ 1974 ] ECR 51 , paragraph 16 , ( BRT I ) and Case C-282/95 P Guérin Automobiles v Commission [ 1997 ] ECR I-1503 , paragraph 39 ) .

It also criticised it for ignoring the impact of older patent protection on the assessment of the functionality of the shape .

Furthermore , under one basic act , the Council is to adopt measures on the basis of Article 133 of the EC Treaty ( now Article 207 of the Treaty ) and , under another basic act , is to repeal the measure in certain circumstances . These provisions should be reconsidered , since , although in the past the Council has reserved powers for itself , in reality the measures taken under these provisions would not be regarded as either delegated acts or implementing acts , but rather as basic acts or amendments thereto , which are now the subject of Article 207 of the Treaty .

In the present case , that choice does not constitute a disadvantage for the employee and is consistent with the intention of the contracting parties to comply with the law of the same State . 60 As is apparent from recital 13 in the preamble to Regulation No 44/2001 , the specific rules in Section 5 of Chapter II are intended to provide the worker with adequate protection .

In the north , however , Melkor had built his power , and he had not slept , but he was awake and working ; and the evil creatures he had corrupted walked the world , and the dark , dormant woods were inhabited by monsters and ghostly ghosts . In later days they were called Balrogs in Middle - earth . In that dark time Melkor had grown many other monsters of various shapes and species that had long conquered the world , and his realm was still south of Middle - earth . Melkor had also built the fortress and armory near the northwest shore of the sea to resist a possible attack from Aman . the fortress was commanded by Melkor 's aide , Sauron , and his name was Angband .

It can be inferred from this description of the activity , first , that the director of voluntary sales of chattels by public auction must be aware of the provisions of French law relating to the sale of chattels by public auction , since he is the person who carries out and organises sales at public auction and , second , that he must also provide legal advice to the owner of the property to be sold in public auctions , as the latter 's agent .

The strong Keltset might have raised his captive from the ground like a feather , but since he was busy supporting Panamon , it was useless to waste his powers on a matter that did n't even matter .

Notes This appropriation is intended to cover special allowances and the related interest due to accounting officers , accounting officers and imprest administrators in accordance with Article 75 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities ( OJ L 356 , 31.12.1977 , p. 1 ) , as last amended by Regulation ( EC , ECSC , Euratom ) 2/2001 ( OJ L 111 , 20.4.2001 , p. 1 ) . It should be added that the perpetrator 's guilt , being the condition of making claims for damages , has a slightly different scope in the civil law and in the criminal law ; this may influence the choice of the method employed for claiming damages .
R48	Also the limitation periods for claims are different in the civil law ( much longer ) and in the criminal law . How should I put forward the claim for damages , and to whom ? detailed provisions on this criminal penalty are contained in Article 46 of the Criminal Code . The legislator considers compensation for damage resulting from an offence causing death , serious detriment to health , disturbance of the functioning of a bodily organ or disturbance to health , an offence against safety in traffic or an offence against the environment , property or business transactions to be the integral part of a judgment on the offender 's criminal liability . A judgment ordering compensation for damage caused as a result of an offence is considered to be an obligation of the court if the victim or other person entitled ( e.g. closest relative in accordance with the Criminal Code ) lodges a motion for issuance of this kind of a judgment . Such a proposal should be lodged directly by the court in a hearing . There is no problem if the victim wishes to lodge a motion already in the preparatory proceedings , but the court decides on its effectiveness in the final judgment . In such a case , the court adjudicates ( obligatorily ) on the obligation to compensate for the damage in whole or in part .
R49	often , especially after a longer period of time , it is not possible to accurately assess the scope of damage resulting from an offence . Read the package leaflet before use . For oral use . the market for derivatives ( commodity ) Mr. Claude is dead . Why ? they fished his body out of the Seine . Looks like he 's been there for , like , three months . I ca n't say I 'm surprised . it was a booze of the highest level . Yes , he was a drunk . Yes , he was a drunk ! he 'd drink the whole Seine . Stop ! Let me go ! Let go of me ! - Do you think you could run away from me ? In exceptional cases a party make take interim measures , but then must immediately report them for ratification by the court . For example , a creditor who has a document conferring a valid claim as provided by the law ( e.g. a notarial deed ) can seize assets belonging to the debtor held by a third party . the attached assets will then be frozen , though still held by the third party , who can not dispose of them , and a forced sale can be ordered only with the approval of the court . As has been seen , the court 's authorisation may in some cases be obtained by simple application with supporting documents and explanations .
R50	There are many specific statutory provisions organising interim measures applicable in specific matters ( e.g. in regard to leases , co - ownership of an estate , joint ownership of property , succession , matrimonial property regimes etc . ) . Where no specific procedure is provided for , a party wishing a measure to be ordered must apply to the urgent applications court . They have general jurisdiction to order interim or precautionary measures either to preclude imminent degradation of assets or to bring a halt to a manifestly unlawful breach of order ( section 933 of the New Code of Civil Procedure ) . But there are exceptional procedures , often highly technical , in which a lawyer will be essential . Where , for example , a court has ordered assets to be attached , the order will have to be enforced by a bailiff . Maybe it was pretty pointless to go to the bridge . Look at the veins . No drug made by man will do that . Come on . Come on . Where 's the breathing machine ? Zed , what 's going on ? Hey , we need some help here ! Please do n't move your head , ma'am . How 's Zed ?

R59	the conditions governing appointment and term of office are laid down in the relevant Regulation for each agency . With the exception of Regulation No 1360/90 establishing a European Training Foundation and recently adopted Regulation No 851/2004 establishing a European Centre for disease prevention and control , the basic Regulations for the Community agencies use the term " renewal " for extending the director 's term of office . In the Treaty establishing the European Community , Article 214(1 ) ( on appointing Commission Members ) and Articles 223 and 225 ( on appointing Court Judges ) contain the same provision . However , in both cases it is agreed that the possibility of renewal does not mean that a simplified procedure is applicable or that the term of office is extended without complying with the appointment procedure laid down in the Treaty . Under these conditions , the fact that the term of office may be renewed must be interpreted as meaning that the person who holds the position must apply for a new term after the expiry of his term of office . For the agencies , this interpretation leads to the conclusion that the possibility of renewing the director 's term of office does not exempt the incumbent from following the appointment procedure laid down in the basic Regulation .
R60	Moreover , directors of agencies and their deputies are not only in office but also agency staff employed under temporary contracts and subject to the Conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities ( hereinafter referred to as the Conditions of Employment ) . The appointment procedure must therefore include publication of the post in all Member States and a selection procedure in compliance with the rules deriving from the basic Regulations and the Conditions of Employment . these procedures are usually lengthy and relatively expensive . They may also slow down or complicate the work of the Agency during that period , if the incumbent director decides to apply for an additional term . Given the agencies ' special needs and the procedure in past years , it therefore does not seem appropriate to carry out a selection procedure for the agencies to carry out a selection procedure each time the first term of office of a director or other relevant person , as the case may be , comes to an end . The appointment authorities should have the option of either prolonging the current term of office or setting out a new selection procedure . After prior notice of at least six months , the carrier may discontinue the operation of services .

R81	In the overall economic situation towards the economic downturn ( in 2002 the EU GDP growth rate in 2002 was around 1 % , while for 2003 , 0.8 % is expected to grow ) , the reduction in the number of jobs available may undermine the interest in job change and thus negatively affect overall mobility . In 2002 , the percentage of workers remaining less than one year for the same employer ( 16,4 % ) was lower than the percentage calculated for 2000 ( 17,5 % ) . However , on the basis of an assessment of the achievements and failures so far , the report points out that work mobility has been supported by a number of Council decisions to be achieved by 2010 , as well as the Europass framework promoting transparency and transferability of qualifications . Despite the delay in the proposal for a directive on the harmonisation and recognition of qualifications and work on work immigration , the possibility of geographical mobility has improved , in particular thanks to the European Health Insurance Card and better coordination of social security claims . Positive measures such as the launch of the European Job Mobility Portal , the launch of an information campaign on mobility or the modernisation of the EURES portal .

R83	The excessive deficit procedures have been proposed to take very high account of economic circumstances . The definition of ' exceptional circumstances' , which allows the Pact to avoid an excessive deficit procedure , could be adjusted to allow for a long - term recession to be taken into account . The correction process of the excessive deficit could be adjusted to take account of both cyclical and sustainability risks . This means that the adjustment path is more consistent with the characteristics of the country concerned , since it ensures that the correction of the deficit can be carried out within a broader period of time than that following the year in which the deficit was reported ; to ensure the effectiveness of the preventive activities in the correction of disproportionate budgetary positions .

Partial waste gas recirculation is a specific case of heat recovery from sinter gas waste gases and is described in BAT 23 . This is the only practical way of recovering heat from the waste gases at the time of text ( 2010 ) . significant heat in the hot air from the sinter cooler can be regenerated by one or more of the following methods : production of steam for use in the iron and steel works production of hot water for district heating in the agglomerator of the agglomeration of gas use from the agglomeration of the agglomeration erat in the waste gas recirculation system . Applicability In some installations due to the current arrangement , the costs of recovery of heat from sinter waste gases or waste gas from a chilled agglomeration are very high . Heat recovery from waste gases in the heat exchanger would lead to unacceptable condensation and corrosion problems .

R126	38 Next , it should be noted that such a tax applies only to external advertising activities , including the use of public spaces managed by the municipal authorities , and that its amount is fixed at a level which can be regarded as being small in relation to the value of the services provided . In any event , the levying of such a tax is not such as to prohibit , distort or otherwise render less attractive the provision of advertising services to be carried out in the territory of the municipalities concerned , including those of a cross - border nature by reason of the registered office of the service provider or recipient of the services . 39 It follows from the foregoing considerations that Article 49 EC must be interpreted as not precluding the levying of a tax such as the municipal advertising tax introduced by Decree - Law No 507/93 .

In other words , the NPC is completely under the control of the government ; 4 . the NPC is responsible for the development and operation of the country 's petrochemical sector , and for this reason it has been entrusted with the management of the Petrochemical Special Economic Zone . As regards the existence of an advantage granted to the recipient company , the investigation established that STPC , as set up at the present time , could not continue to operate without financial support from the NPC . This practice is not in line with the normal investment practice of private investors , since no commercial organisation would have provided such non - repayable funds . The financial intervention of the NPC is specific within the meaning of Article 4(2)(a ) of the basic Regulation , since the granting authority , in line with its policy of developing the Petrochemical Sector , explicitly limits access to this subsidy to STPC only .
R141	( c ) Calculation of the subsidy amount The amount of countervailable subsidy is calculated by reference to the benefit conferred on the recipient , which is found to exist during the investigation period . It is considered that the benefit conferred on the recipient is the total amount of non - repayable funds , as reported by the cooperating exporting producer in its financial statements . In accordance with Article 7(2 ) of the basic Regulation , this subsidy amount ( nominator ) has been allocated over the total sales turnover of the company during the investigation period because the subsidy is not contingent upon export performance and it was not granted by reference to the quantities manufactured , produced , exported or transported . 3.2 .

R145	surveillance under the responsibility of the notified body The purpose of surveillance is to make sure that the manufacturer duly fulfils the obligations arising out of the approved quality system . The manufacturer shall , for assessment purposes , allow the notified body access to the manufacture , inspection , testing and storage sites and shall provide it with all necessary information , in particular the quality system documentation , the quality records , such as inspection reports and test data , calibration data , qualification reports on the personnel concerned , etc . The notified body shall periodically carry out audits to make sure that the manufacturer maintains and applies the quality system and shall provide the manufacturer with an audit report . In addition , the notified body may pay unexpected visits to the manufacturer . During such visits , the notified body may , if necessary , carry out tests , or have them carried out , in order to verify that the quality system is functioning correctly . The notified body shall provide the manufacturer with a visit report and , if tests have been carried out , with a test report . The manufacturer shall draw up a written declaration of conformity for each product model and keep it at the disposal of the national authorities for 10 years after the product has been placed on the market . The declaration of conformity shall identify the product model for which it has been drawn up .

As regards the scope , an explicit reference to sexual orientation was not included as a ground on the basis of which discrimination is prohibited . While provisions concerning the right of appeal before the national courts have been introduced , the claim for damages and the individual liability of the offenders , as well as references to civil , administrative and criminal liability , it is still necessary to clarify which sanctions and compensation in cases of discrimination are laid down in the relevant codes and laws . The Supreme Court issued an opinion on 7 May , in which it expressly confirms that sexual orientation is implicit in the existing legislation as a prohibited ground for discrimination .
R147	The anti - discrimination legislation has been improved to provide the necessary legal basis for ensuring the implementation of the anti - discrimination criteria , but will require further legal safeguards in the implementation phase in order to ensure adequate and effective protection against discrimination on any ground , as well as procedural guarantees , and to ensure that any derogation under the Ukrainian legal system is applied in accordance with the principles of necessity and proportionality . In addition to the provisions guaranteeing protection against discrimination , the Commission 's third report also highlighted that the Commission would closely monitor further developments in the draft Bill No 0711 ( later 0945 ) and 0290 . They contained proposals for changes to different laws and restrictions on freedom of expression by prohibiting ' promotion of homosexuality' . The Ukrainian Government has guaranteed that these bills have been withdrawn from the parliamentary register . As regards monitoring the specific recommendations of the Council of Europe / ECRI for the protection of minorities , Ukraine ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and in January 2006 the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages . in 2012 , a Law on the Principles of National Language Policy , which remains in force , was adopted .

It 's $ 50 an hour , twice a week . Well , it 's gon na kind of interfere with swimming training . You know , I gave up a long time ago . I thought it was an isolated case of corruption . and , of course , that was a mistake . and it 's clear that the job was to look for : how much oil there is , where it is , who owns it . It was known that this event , this collapse , was coming . Saudi ARIA Saudi Arabia has 25 % of the known oil reserves on the planet . On the questions referred Preliminary observations 22 In the first place , it should be borne in mind that , under the CMO in the sugar sector , the basic regulation provides for a system of national quotas for the production of sugar in the European Union . The sugar produced under these quotas can be put into circulation in the Union and it is subject to various measures in support of production .
R153	Under Article 26 of the basic Regulation , that sugar must , in principle , be exported outside the Union by 1 January following the end of the marketing year in question . 24 It is clear from Articles 1 and 2 of Regulation No 2670/81 that each manufacturer must , in principle , export the C sugar which he has produced . However , as pointed out in recital 5 in the preamble to that regulation , the EU legislature considered it appropriate to allow those producers to export sugar which they themselves did not produce . 25 To that end , the second subparagraph of Article 2(2 ) of that regulation provides for a mechanism which allows the manufacturer to replace , when exporting quantities of C sugar to be exported , the corresponding quantity of quota sugar produced by another producer established in the territory of the same Member State . Thus , it is clear from that provision that , by changing the accounting nature , the sugar which has originally fallen under the C sugar category will be replaced by quota sugar and that the manufacturer may freely put it into circulation in the internal market , whereas the replacement sugar originally produced under the quota is exported as C sugar .
R154	29It should be borne in mind , first of all , that Article 14(3 ) of Regulation No 1998/78 provides that where the quantity of C sugar is replaced when exported by an equivalent quantity of A or B sugar , the quantity replaced is , for the purposes of reimbursement , considered as A sugar from the day on which the export customs formalities were completed . 30 Having regard to the wording of that provision , it must be held that it merely specifies the time from which the quantity of C sugar properly replaced by sugar subject to quota must be regarded , for the purposes of calculating the storage costs to be paid , for sugar constituting entitlement to that refund . 31 As regards a situation such as that in the main proceedings , where the manufacturer wishes to replace the quantity of C sugar corresponding to the quantity of quota sugar produced by another producer , the conditions laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 2(2 ) of Regulation No 2670/81 must also be taken into account . No , I 'm good with Rachel right now . I 'd like to give it a shot . I mean , they understood each other at the diner , so maybe ... and even if I were , I do n't think I 'd be sexually competent .

Annex COMMITMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT REPUBLIC RELATING TO PIRAEUS BANK The Hellenic Republic shall ensure that the Bank carries out a restructuring plan submitted on 25 June 2014 . The restructuring plan is based on the macroeconomic assumptions set by the European Commission ( ' the Commission' ) in the Appendix as well as on regulatory assumptions . The Hellenic Republic hereby provides the following commitments ( ' the undertakings' ) which are an integral part of the restructuring plan .
R169	commitments include commitments relating to the implementation of the Restructuring Plan ( hereinafter referred to as the Restructuring Commitments ) and the commitments on corporate governance and commercial activities . the commitments shall take effect on the date of adoption of the Commission Decision approving the restructuring plan ( hereinafter referred to as ' the Decision' ) . The restructuring period will expire on 31 December 2018 . The commitments shall apply throughout the restructuring period unless otherwise specified in the individual commitment . ( 1 ) Bank : Piraeus Bank S.A. and all its subsidiaries . Such a controlled liquidation , which may be carried out in conjunction with a contribution from public funds , may be applied on a case - by - case basis either as a second step after rescue aid to an individual financial institution , provided that it is clear that the financial institution can not be undertaken successfully or as a single action . A managed liquidation may also be part of a general guarantee scheme , i.e. where a Member State starts liquidating financial institutions for which the guarantee has to be activated . The assessment of such a system and the individual liquidation measures adopted under such a system , by analogy , follow , mutatis mutandis , the same principles as those set out above for guarantee schemes . The specific nature of the liquidation measure gives rise to the following considerations .
R170	In the context of liquidation , care should be taken in particular to limit as much as possible moral hazard , in particular by excluding shareholders and , where appropriate , certain types of borrowers in order to benefit from any aid in connection with controlled winding - up . In order to avoid undue distortions of competition , the liquidation phase should be limited to the time strictly necessary for the orderly winding - up . The banking licence should be withdrawn as soon as possible . In ensuring that the amount of aid will be limited to the minimum necessary in view of the objective pursued , it should be borne in mind that safeguarding financial stability under the current financial turmoil may mean that certain creditors of the liquidated bank need to be repaid by way of aid measures . selection of the criteria for selecting the types of commitments for this purpose should follow the same rules as for the commitments covered by the guarantee scheme . In order to ensure that no aid is granted to the buyers of the financial institution or parts of it or sold , it is important that certain conditions of sale are respected .

Contrary to the view taken by the Appeals Directorate , that conclusion is not called into question by the fact that , in the present state of EU law , the gift tax is not harmonised and therefore falls within the competence of the Member States . In the exercise of their powers , the Member States must comply with EU law ( 8 ) , since , under Article 4(3 ) TEU , the Member States must refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the objectives of the European Union . 9 Article 6 of the WFV provides :
R174	10 Under Article 7 of that law : 11 Under Article 8 of the WFV , ' contributions' means the taxable income or taxable income , within the meaning of the Netherlands Law on Income Tax ( Wet op de inkomstenbelasting , ' the WIB' ) . The impact of asset relief is therefore significant , since BankCo is not burdened with these losses . In accordance with point 41 of the IAC , a comprehensive restructuring of the Bank is therefore required . In this context , it is undisputed that , without the aid , NR would have entered technical insolvency . NR was nationalised after the United Kingdom failed to sell NR to third parties . This is further illustrated by the exemptions which NR acquired from the FSA , firstly , the possibility of including all Tier 2 capital into the capital position provided for in the regulation and subsequently acting in breach of the regulatory capital requirements . It is clear from the submission of the UK authorities that if the bank had not been split up , a capital injection of at least GBP 6 billion would have been necessary ( for comparison , before the crisis the bank 's capital was less than GBP 2 billion ) to make the bank viable . Without State intervention , the division of NR and consequently the maintenance of its economic activities through BankCo would not have been feasible .

In elderly patients ( 65 years and over ) , at a dose of LUMIGAN 0.3 mg / ml twice daily , the mean AUC0 - 24h bimatoprost was 0.0634 ng#h / ml , which is significantly greater than 0.0218 ng#h / ml in youths . However , this finding is not clinically relevant since the systemic exposure of elderly and younger subjects was very low at ocular administration . effects in non - clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use . The increase in iris pigmentation appears to be due to increased stimulation of melanin production in melanocytes , not by increasing the number of melanocytes . bimatoprost was not mutagenic or carcinogenic in vitro and in vivo series . bimatoprost did not interfere with fertility in rats up to a dose of 0.6 mg / kg / day ( at least 103-fold the expected human exposure ) .

R180	The syndicate of OP 84 therefore brought an appeal in cassation before the Conseil d'État ( Council of State ) . ( 16 ) In support of its appeal , Syndicat OP 84 relies , inter alia , on an error of law committed by the Cour administrative d'appel de Marseille by holding that the administration was able to initiate an inspection during the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 and to continue that check during the scrutiny period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2000 . 01 , without infringing Article 2 of Regulation No 4045/89 , on the ground that effective control could not be carried out during the first period following the conduct of the Syndicat OP 84 . 17 Taking the view that the answer to this ground of appeal raises questions concerning the interpretation of the relevant provisions of Regulation No 4045/89 , the Conseil d'État decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling : " I have a perfectly accurate answer , " he insisted . " You have to come up with it . " " I have n't heard anything like that , " the giant complained . but he sat down and tugged at his beard with a dirty hand . " Why does the chicken cross the road ?

R184	This detailed framework seeks to get answers from a number of hundreds of interested organisations interested in publishing their opinions . However , in this opinion , the EESC confines itself to comments on key policy issues and considers that it will have to decide on a case - by - case basis , as it has already done in its opinion on the Directive on the protection of consumers in the case of distance contracts ( Opinion INT/334 on Commission Communication COM(2006 ) 514 final of 21 September 2006 ) . for different ( and differing ) social and economic reasons , Member States will either wish to maintain the current level of consumer protection or to gradually change that level of protection at a different pace of their choice . It is much easier to align this position with the principle of subsidiarity that it respects . This also recognises the view that different categories of consumers across the EU are disadvantaged in terms of the current level of protection or the possibility to seek redress , and that appropriate action is needed at EU and Member State level .

Increasing the coherence of European contract law will simplify cross - border transactions . businesses do not sufficiently benefit from the potential of the potential hidden in the Internet to promote sales : Union law can help by increasing the need for legal certainty for businesses while guaranteeing the highest level of consumer protection . Finally , increasing the use of alternative dispute resolution can contribute to the efficient administration of justice . criminal law is a relatively new area of EU activity , for which the Treaty of Lisbon defines a clear legal framework . The criminal justice strategy , fully respecting subsidiarity and cohesion , should lead to EU policy to reconcile substantive and procedural criminal law . This should be continued in close cooperation between the European Parliament , national parliaments and the Council , while acknowledging that the emphasis remains primarily on the mutual recognition and harmonisation of criminal offences and sanctions in selected cases . a strong common European procedural basis is needed . A new and comprehensive system of gathering evidence in cross - border cases and better exchange of information between Member States ' authorities on criminal offences are essential tools in developing a functional area of freedom , security and justice .

While short - term economic benefits may be relatively limited due to the lack of non - stop flights between the Community and Australia and the already reached degree of market access , the economic impact of the agreement with Australia will be significant . A recent study has confirmed that the regulatory and policy framework for air transport in Australia would allow the Community to reach a model agreement with Australia that would lead to a higher level of regulatory convergence and new opportunities for the EU industry and its users . An open aviation area with Australia could enhance the competitiveness of EU airlines on the EU - Australia market vis - à - vis competitors from the Middle and Far East . This could lead to an increase in direct flights between the EU and Australia and a better distribution to air traffic , which is currently very focused on London .

We used to play jokes and watch movies on the video I bought her . how many times we laughed , as she liked to say . And my memory of the night I had met Staub had never faded , nor seemed to me a mere dream , as I had anticipated ; every event since the moment the old man had urged me to wish for something on the full moon , to the groping fingers on my shirt , as Staub had pinned my badge , remained perfectly clear . And then there was a day when I could n't find the badge . And I knew that when I moved to my little apartment in Falmouth , I still had it , lying in the top drawer of the nightstand , along with a few combs , two sets of cufflinks , and an old political badge that said BILL CLINTON , but then she 's lost somewhere .

The first relates to the transmission of data within or between Community institutions and bodies . For the purposes of this Opinion , the EDPS has developed an independent analysis on the situation of the Member States and on the situation of third countries or international bodies as they are separately governed by Regulation 45/2001 . The first situation is provided for in Article 95(1 ) of the Draft Financial Regulation , which states that the database set up and managed by the Commission is common to the institutions , executive agencies and bodies referred to in Article 185 of the Financial Regulation . The EDPS underlines that Article 7 of Regulation 45/2001 applies to cases where the transfer of personal data within or between Community institutions or bodies is envisaged .
R239	access by Member States , third countries and international organisations is provided for in the second indent of Article 95(2 ) of the Financial Regulation . Member States , third countries and international organisations shall have the right of access and may take into account , where appropriate and on their own responsibility , the information contained in the database in the award of contracts associated with the implementation of the budget . The proposal therefore foresees automatic access to the database in the context of procurement associated with the implementation of the budget . The EDPS underlines that , where the recipients of the data concerned are Member States , Article 8 of Regulation 45/2001 applies . This Article deals with the transfer of personal data to recipients other than the Community institutions and bodies covered by Directive 95/46/EC . Whereas the ' necessity' of the data for carrying out the tasks carried out by the beneficiaries is linked to the method of implementation of the budget chosen by the Commission in this case , is likely to comply with Article 8(a ) . In addition , they operate under national law transposing Directive 95/46/EC and for the purpose of the implementation of the European Union . As regards third countries and international organisations , Article 9 of Regulation 45/2001 ( 14 ) applies .

That decision concerns the whole of the service contract notified by DSD and clarified by the various commitments made by that undertaking in order to clarify its conditions of use . 150 It is therefore necessary to take account of the fact that the Commission agreed to grant an exemption for the contract for the provision of services , since DSD assured it , inter alia , that no provision of that contract could be binding on the collection undertakings to DSD and that it would not bring an action to discontinue third parties in the event of joint use .
R258	Those assurances are decisive , since they allow the Commission to consider that the condition of the exemption linked to competition is satisfied in the present case . It should be noted in that regard that , during the administrative procedure , the Commission made it clear that , without such assurances , it did not intend to grant an authorisation or an exemption for a contract for the provision of services , but that it intended either to consider that the existence of any impediment to access by DSD 's competitors to DSD 's collection facilities constituted restrictions of competition as such ( see paragraph 33 ) , or to ask whether DSD 's conduct intended to prevent its competitors from access to that installation could not be assessed .

Yes ! is Mr. Lamarca home ? Who ? Lamarca . where they moved ? Therefore , the normal value was calculated as indicated in recital ( 26 ) above . The investigation found that the reported cost of production of the company was underestimated because the overheads incurred by the factory ( including depreciation , rental , wages and maintenance ) actually incurred during the IP were reclassified to SG&A costs . In order to reflect the low capacity utilisation of its production facilities , the company claimed that it was applying this practice .
R288	However , the actual costs incurred include the reclassified overhead costs of the Facility . The fact that the company is working on a fraction of its full production capacity does not mean that the costs associated with the production facilities concerned are not costs incurred . of course , these costs were included in the company 's accounting records , and given that they were directly related to the production of the like product , the reported cost of production had to be corrected . In the absence of any sales of the like product on the domestic market and data for the same general category of products , SG&A expenses were established in accordance with Article 2(6)(c ) of the basic Regulation during the IP . In particular , the SG&A is based on the total sales of all products on the domestic market . These costs were added to the company 's own average cost of production for each exported product type during the IP . As regards profit , and in the absence of any other reasonable basis , a profit margin of 5 % was used . No information was available showing that the above profit margin exceeded the profit normally made by other exporters or producers by selling products of the same general category on the Malaysian domestic market , as required by Article 2(6)(c ) of the basic Regulation . The other cooperating exporting producer showed representative sales of the like product on its domestic market .

" Tobin , doubtful , took the quill and tried to write his name , the only word he knew how to say . her mother watched his struggle for a moment , then cautiously took the pen back . he sat very still , wondering if there would be an explosion . Instead , the mother got up and walked over to the windowsill , where there was a line of small waxy and carved wooden figures . " You did that , did n't you ? " Tobin nodded . She looked at all the others : a hawk , a bear , an eagle , a horse running , and an attempt at Tharin with a wooden splinter sword . " They 're not the best , " he said shyly . " I gave them away .

R294	It 's pronounced " Funke . " to the director . Now . I always feel great here . Where , in special circumstances , the Commission decides to initiate an investigation without having received a written complaint by or on behalf of the Community industry for the initiation of such investigation , the investigation shall be carried out only if it has sufficient evidence of dumping , injury and a causal link , as referred to in paragraph 2 , to justify the initiation of an investigation . 38 As regards Directive 97/33 , in the reasoned opinion of 21 March 2002 , the Commission complains that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 7(5 ) of that directive for the years 1998 and 1999 . This complaint is identical to the first plea in law . 39 Consequently , it must be held that the failure to fulfil obligations relating to Directive 97/33 concerns a breach of the obligations incumbent on the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the years 1998 and 1999 from Article 7(5 ) of that directive . In that opinion , it was further stated that ' no monitoring of compliance has been carried out so far ' . In its application , the Commission cites the same plea , again without identifying the period during which it complains that that Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under the provisions of that article .
R295	41 However , it must be pointed out that the wording of the complaints in the reasoned opinion and the pleas in law in the Commission 's application does not support the conclusion that the alleged failure to fulfil obligations covers the whole period between 1998 - the year of the entry into force of Directive 98/10 - and 2002 - the last year preceding the reasoned opinion . In fact , it is clear from the pre - litigation procedure and , in particular , from the letter of formal notice of 21 March 2002 , that the alleged failure to fulfil obligations relates essentially to the year 2000 . 42 The Luxembourg Government submits , first , that the present action is inadmissible since , at the end of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion of 11 July 2003 , the alleged failure to fulfil obligations was no longer in force , since Directive 98/10 was no longer in force . As regards Directive 97/33 , the Community legislature had already adopted the NRF before sending a reasoned opinion of 21 March 2002 . ( Case C-363/00 Commission v Italy [ 2003 ] ECR I-5767 , paragraph 22 ) , Luxembourg The Government argues that it does not apply in the present case . every child knows that .

A statistically significant improvement in pain intensity difference was observed with Effentora over placebo as early as 10 minutes in Study 1 and as early as 15 minutes in Study 2 ( the earliest time interval measured ) . these differences continued to be statistically significant at each time - frame of each individual study . 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties General introduction Fentanyl is highly lipophilic and can be absorbed very rapidly by the oral mucosa and more slowly by the conventional gastrointestinal route . Effentora works with a technology using an effervescent reaction which increases the rate and extent of fentanyl absorbed by the oral mucosa . transient changes in pH accompanying the effervescent reaction may optimise the dissolution ( at a lower pH ) and penetration of the membrane ( at higher pH ) .
R303	the comparative study of one 400 microgram Effentora tablet administered either buccally ( i.e. between the cheek and the gum ) or sublingually met the criteria for bioequivalence .

The anti - tumour activity of topotecan consists of inhibition of the topoisomerase - I enzyme , which plays an important role in the replication process by releasing the torsivity of the DNA molecule before a moving replication fork . Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase - I by stabilising the covalent complex between enzyme and DNA - cleaned DNA , which is an intermediate process of the catalytic process . Inhibition of topoisomerase - I topotecan leads to induction of protein - associated single - form DNA fractures in the cell .

Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union . This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States . Done at Brussels , 15 May 2006 . Part 1 - Coherence , competitiveness , employment and growth - Situation and trends Based on different statistics , the report looks at the cohesion situation in Europe in economic , social and territorial terms , especially in terms of the positive impact on convergence . Using data for 2001 and 2002 , the document assesses in detail progress towards real convergence in the ' cohesion countries' and presents a few prospects for the future . The document also analyses the potential cohesion situation in an enlarged Europe . This part of the report addresses the growth of GDP and employment in the cohesion countries over the last years in relation to the rest of the EU and examines how disparities between regions in 15 EU countries have changed over the last decade with a particular focus on Objective 1 regions .
R314	Despite the positive contribution of the Structural Funds and the progress made , substantial differences remain in the area of prosperity and economic performance , indicating structural weaknesses in some countries and regions . Some European regions are still very isolated and are lagging behind in the area of qualified labour , investment and resources needed to gain access to the information society . It appears that less progress has been made in terms of social cohesion and employment : it appears difficult to reverse long - term unemployment ; a limited increase in employment in 15 EU countries in 2001 , combined with a decrease in employment in the accession countries in recent years , has further exacerbated regional disparities ; In the various European regions there has been a decline in natural population growth and an even greater decline in the future ( demographics forecasts a decline in Member States and acceding countries , with a few exceptions ) ; what is more significant for employment is the expected decline in the working - age population relative to the rest of the population .

The specific programmes of the 7th Framework Programme are further consolidation of the European Research Area in this sector , achieve critical mass and structures in new research areas by new means and further promote the free movement of ideas , knowledge and researchers . Throughout the implementation of the specific programmes , the potential for action at European level to strengthen excellence will be exploited as far as possible . This implies the need to identify and promote the highest quality in the area where the European Union is currently present , creating capacity for excellence and future research . This is in line with the approach to be adopted in the Capacities Specific Programme , as an important aspect of the Euratom Specific Programme is also support for research infrastructures , this time in a specific area such as nuclear science and technology .

The concept of patriotism has a rich historical connotation in Czech society . patriotism was the source of the revitalization of the Czech nation in the 19th century . The narrow layers of Czech society revived the Czech people through culture .
R323	At present , access by certain elite groups to patriotism is contradictory , and is often linked to nationalism . And some constitutional officials devalue Czech patriotism and understand it as something overwhelmed , which is not a modern society . On the other hand , the primitive masses of the masses , which resemble the ancient bouquets of the world , which take place in the field of hockey championships , are accepted as an appropriate manifestation of patriotism . patriotism is sometimes understood to be something that is in contradiction with European integration , with the formation of a European identity and the application of multicultural in modern society .

At birth , the child 's residence ( the original domicile ) is the same as the father 's place of residence at the time of the child 's birth , if the child is legitimate . This rule continues to apply until the child is 16 years of age , i.e. residence changes according to the change in the father 's residence or mother 's residence .
R326	However , if the parents are separated and the child lives with the mother only , the residence of the mother can then be resident , even if his or her principal place of residence has been determined by the place of residence of the father . In the case of persons over 16 years of age , the previous place of residence shall apply unless they accept a residence of choice . A person must reside in the relevant country and intend to reside there for an indefinite period of time or for a permanent period of time . If a choice of choice is made , the original residence shall again be repaid until the person has taken up his or her habitual residence .

Interested parties may submit their comments on the aid in respect of which the Commission is initiating the procedure within one month of the date of publication of this summary and the following letter , to : European Commission Directorate - General for Competition State aid Greffe J-70 3/219 1049 Bruxelles / Brussel BELGIQUE / BELGIË Fax + 32 22961242 These comments will be communicated to Bulgaria . Confidential treatment of the identity of the interested party submitting the comments may be requested in writing , stating the reasons for the request . The complaint concerned alleged State aid incurred in Bulgaria from the exchange of publicly owned land for privately owned land . Both the swap and the change in the use of the land were based on Bulgarian legislation which entered into force before Bulgaria 's accession to the European Union . Both the swaps of forest land with private parties and the subsequent changes in the use of the land were prohibited or suspended in 2009 .
R331	The scheme would , after the implementation of the two phases , allow undertakings to obtain an economic advantage , since the prices of publicly owned land charged in the case of exchange and/or subsequent change in the use of land would be lower than the market price for a comparable parcel sold on the market . Thus , Article 10(1 ) of the regulation on own resources provides that the amounts entered in the B accounts are to be credited within the period referred to therein from the time they are paid and not , as the Commission asserts , to be settled from the time of payment in the A accounts . The amounts entered in the B account are subject , in any event , to the obligation of timely crediting , so that the transfer of these amounts to the A accounts appears redundant and would lead , in the light of the first subparagraph of Article 10(1 ) of the Own Resources Regulation , to certain discrepancies , since the time - limit for crediting the deposits entered in the A account is linked to the time when the entitlement is established . The final TAC will be established in the context of new scientific evidence during the first half of 2006 . The ' unlawful use' is defined in Article 202 of the Customs Code , which defines it as ' any introduction of goods contrary to Articles 38 to 41 and the second indent of Article 177' .

The courses planned by DHL for security staff correspond , to a large extent , to the content and hours training hours provided for by the training programme for aviation safety inspectors carrying out checks on persons and cargo to implement Regulation ( EC ) No 2320/02 . The IATA PK 7/8 training module is also required under the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations , which have been transposed into German law by NfL II-36/05 . Under the German law on safety at work for compulsory education , also a course for first aid and fire protection .
R333	However , since Germany stressed that DHL wishes to provide all the services associated with the operation of the logistics centre itself , and has not demonstrated that DHL would not have provided these courses without aid , the Commission considers that they belong to the overall training package . The courses for security staff ' DIN EN 9001:2000' and ' DIN EN 14001' correspond to Deutsche Post 's normal commercial practice and are therefore necessary for all DHL employees ( see paragraph 80 ) . It would be pointless to jeopardise the smooth operation of the logistics centre because a security worker does not have access to the apron ( as mentioned in paragraph 90 et seq . , it is possible in this case to limit training to a certain number of persons ) . In line with the assessment framework set out in paragraph 25 , the Commission concluded that the training measures , although not required by law , were necessary for the smooth operation of the logistics centre , so that DHL would do so in any event . As the training courses mentioned in paragraphs 83 and 84 are laid down by law for security officers , the Commission can not accept Germany 's claim that DHL could only accept a minimum number of qualified personnel who would then train other employees in the workplace .

The Cypriot authorities reiterated the importance of Cyprus Airways for the economy and the transport connections of the island and insisted that the restlessness in the Middle East was an exceptional and unforeseeable situation that had an impact on Cyprus Airways . The Cypriot authorities doubted that competitors could solve a lack of transport links in the event of the bankruptcy of Cyprus Airways , given the seasonal nature of the market . As regards the compatibility of the measures with the 2004 Rescue and Restructuring Guidelines , the Cypriot authorities insisted that the 2013 Restructuring Plan was based on realistic assumptions and did not underestimate the negative effects arising from the small fleet or difficulties in implementing cost initiatives . In their submission of 9 September 2013 , the Cypriot authorities also stated that no ex gratia payments would be made available to the redundant employees . In their submission of 3 August 2014 , the Cypriot authorities clarified that the Government had , for socio - economic reasons , made a direct substitute for former Cyprus Airways employees who had already given notice of resignation or had been made redundant . The decision was taken and the reimbursements were paid only after the departure or dismissal , so there was no State aid to Cyprus Airways .

Therefore , the Member States have the right to decide which method to apply when drawing up their allocation plan , as well as what data and projections they use to determine the emissions approved for the installation during a period determined by that plan . 37 In the present case , however , the Commission did not take account of the method by which the Republic of Estonia established its allocation plan . It is apparent from the fifth and sixth recitals in the preamble to the contested decision that , for the purpose of learning a permissible total quantity of allowances , the Commission used its own method and that it was based on the basic data which it had chosen and the Primes model prepared by the Greek expert and , in essence , ignored the allocation plan for the Republic of Estonia . 38 In its defence , the Republic of Estonia adds that the concept of ' maximum amount' which , according to the Commission , constitutes an external limit applicable to the total quantity of allowances issued by a Member State is not based on any legal basis and does not appear either in the Directive or in the contested decision .
R339	41 The Commission outlined , as a preliminary point , the Community greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme and , in particular , that , during the first period of application of the system , which covered the period from 2005 to 2007 , there was a significant amount of overallocation in relation to emissions verified in 2005 and 2006 , so that the environmental system 's usefulness for the environment , if any , was very limited . 42 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland submits that , if the Commission had not succeeded in any of the cases relating to national allocation plans , there would have been a risk that the price of allowances during the second stage would be substantially reduced as a result of the excess supply of allowances which would have occurred , which would effectively eliminate the effects of the directive as an instrument for reducing emissions . in other words , it would be catastrophic . The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland invites the Court to carry out a teleological interpretation of the Directive which enables the Commission to effectively control the national allocation plans and thus to prevent Member States from setting maximum amounts which could not lead to an increase in the price of carbon oxides and , consequently , to stimulate emissions reductions .
R340	43 Next , the Commission and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland state that , in the contested decision , the Commission did not fix the total quantity of allowances which the Republic of Estonia may allocate but determined the maximum value of that total quantity . If you want to suppress the settings for the formatting of widgets , proceed as follows : b ) When do I have to choose a court other than that in the place where the defendant lives ( court determined by the application of the basic rule ) ?

This group , for example , includes actions relating to industrial property . exclusive jurisdiction may only be provided for by law . the designated court is normally the metropolitan court . c ) Can the parties themselves attribute jurisdiction to a court that would not be competent otherwise ? In property - related cases the parties may attribute jurisdiction to a particular court for resolve a particular dispute or the disputes which may arise from a particular legal relationship .

The impact assessment examines two main options with a number of variables : the variant and the variant of the legislative proposal . The option of a legislative proposal is divided into two sub - options : decentralised and centralised data collection for air transport . Following the impact assessment , it was concluded that a legislative proposal with a decentralised data processing system was a preferred option . The policy option of maintaining the status quo does not present any real force in improving security in the EU .
R385	The costs for transport and administrative arrangements would ultimately be much lower than when Member States develop their own systems . comfort for passengers would increase by reducing the time needed for border control . In choosing between the policy of maintaining the status quo and the legislative proposal , the legislative proposal is clear advantages . In the choice between two options in the case of a legislative proposal , the option of decentralised data collection is an advantage from the centralised option as regards the improvement of EU security . The option of centralised data collection would have a high risk of failure both at political level because of failure to ensure adequate cooperation between Member States and at practical level because of a system that would not be operational and reliable .

The EESC does not recommend the possibility of doing nothing , in other words to preserve the current situation . Due to obstacles , cross - border voting for small shareholders is unattainable and very costly for institutional investors . It stresses , in particular , that the fight against illegal gaming , which is the greatest threat to consumer protection , is not a priority of the Communication . The EESC calls on the Commission to include , among the priorities to which the Communication seeks an answer , the creation of new jobs and the protection of jobs in the sector , their quality and their potential loss in the field of traditional gambling in favour of online games . Gambling contributes to increasing the tax revenues of the Member States . The EESC believes that all activities at European level in the field of gaming should focus on a European social model that allows citizens to enjoy healthy and balanced entertainment . The EESC has serious concerns about the high risk of gambling for public health .
R392	The EESC supports the Commission 's objective that each Member State should have its own regulatory authority with precise powers that guarantee close cooperation with competent authorities in other Member States . The EESC notes that it is currently not possible to adopt specific EU legislation on online gambling . While supporting the European Commission 's initiatives , in particular as regards effective cooperation between Member States , the Committee hopes that , in certain areas where competences are shared , more effective legal instruments ( if possible ) will be adopted to protect consumers and the most vulnerable groups and to combat illegal operators and against money laundering . This would create a minimum set of consumer protection rules . Member States must continue to have the right to adopt a stricter consumer protection rule for their domestic market , if they wish , or to continue applying the existing more modest rules ( 3 ) . I relaxed . She 's crazy . Outlook for 2007 The Commission will : - draw up a Green Paper on a Sustainable Consumption and Production Action Plan based on instruments such as integrated product policy , including eco - labels , environmental management systems , resource and waste policies and innovation . - develop measures for the ecological industrial policy , using elements such as the internal market , the Directive on the ecological design of energy - using products , dynamic markets and other support for eco - innovation and international cooperation .
R393	- prepare a report on the implementation of the Environmental Technologies Action Plan ( ETAP ) , which will include the first results of cooperation with Member States . - present a Green Paper on ship dismantling . Policy of the ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION Main elements Use of better regulation for better implementation and environmental performance Environmental policy has already yielded good results which could , however , be even better in the case of a more effective and easier implementation . The important aspect of better regulation is to ensure that the administrative requirements for the provision of information prescribed by law are proportionate to what is necessary for the proper implementation . While the administrative costs of environmental legislation represent only a small fraction of all benefits resulting from them , unnecessary costs prevent and deal with good implementation . Simplification In 2006 , the Commission continued to revise regulations such as the Dangerous Substances Directive , the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive and the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive under the simplification rolling programme [ 30 ] . It would bring together three existing directives and clarify some key , but poorly implemented , legislation . The Commission proposed a directive for the protection of surface water[33 ] against pollution - with the setting of restrictions for 41 hazardous substances - which repeals five directives and reporting requirements .

For this purpose , the crucial point in time is the birth of the child or the time the marriage was dissolved if this takes place earlier . relationships between parents and children are governed by the common national law of the parents , failing which they are subject to the law of their habitual joint residence ; if the parents normally reside in different countries , the personal law of the child will apply .

The analysis of the bids and changes to the providers has shown that Syniverse and BSG do not represent particularly competitive pressure vis - à - vis each other and that MACH exerts a stronger competitive constraint on both Syniverse and BSG .
R423	In addition , due to the characteristics of the market for roaming clearing services , providers have a strong incentive to compete aggressively for each contract that is renewed . It is clear from both the parties and the customers that BSG and Syniverse are exposed to strong competition from MACH . This means that the MNOs considered that the tender was sufficiently competitive with two participants , namely MACH and BSG or MACH and Syniverse . The analysis of the ranking data showed that Syniverse and BSG were very rarely the winner and the other in order of the same competition . Regardless of the different costs and work associated with the switching of the supplier , the market investigation confirmed that this change is possible and that in many cases the MNOs have changed the roaming provider . The costs incurred by the transition to another provider can be offset by the savings made by such a change . The Commission found that there were several changes of provider between 2004 and 2007 in Europe . The market investigation has also shown that the switch from BSG to Syniverse ( and vice versa ) is highly rare . The characteristics of the market clearing services market are such that the providers provide incentives for intensive competition , which means that unilaterally by the merged entity would not be likely . First , there are no capacity constraints .

R431	Although the PNG authorities involved in the implementation of the catch certification scheme under the EU IUU Regulation generally seem willing to cooperate and provide feedback to requests for information or to verify regularity , the reliability or correctness of their replies are at risk and undermines the lack of transparency and small or no potential for ensuring the traceability of fishery products , as set out in section 3 , paragraph 1 of this Decision . Within the framework of the overall assessment of PNG 's duties as flag , port or coastal State , the Commission has also examined whether PNG cooperates with other flag States in the fight against IUU fishing . For this purpose , it was established during the Commission mission in November 2012 that PNG authorities were not willing to cooperate with flag States of vessels fishing in the waters under PNG jurisdiction , as these authorities were not willing to provide flag States with information on vessel data .

R446	first it is necessary to consider the lawfulness of the Netherlands requirement , and not the other . In this case , unlike the situation of Bulgarian nationals , the status of nationals of the Associated Countries is legal until they decide to apply for a residence permit for establishment . As a result of the application , not only are they unable to exercise the right of establishment through a given application , but are also deprived of their right to short stay under the Schengen regime . This automatic illegality constitutes an additional sanction which appears to be unjustified and excessively strict for the exercise of the right in an otherwise lawful legal position and does not correspond to any important legitimate aim which is no longer guaranteed by the principal requirement for a temporary residence permit . This does not in any way affect the question whether the requirement for temporary residence permits obtained in the country of origin is compatible with the agreements .

The Commission therefore indicated in the context of the passive management of resources that in view of the consequences of the strengthening of PI 's financial independence ( the risk of legislative changes , followed by a significant reduction in cash deposited with the Treasury / private debtor ) , a private debtor would , at the time of the negotiation of the agreement , have regarded the five - year period as the maximum period for establishing his own bid . Italy indicated that , in the specific context of PI 's active liquidity management ( actually carried out since 2007 ) , the [ ... ] model supports PI in selecting the optimal asset allocation and the risk / return .

In some areas , prices are under pressure again , and the situation could be exacerbated if more expensive and more expensive mortgage funding is available , which can happen . As housing construction is a fundamental driver of consumer behaviour , a further significant drop in family housing will undermine confidence and reduce spending . As a result , it will also be harder for Americans to move in some parts of the country , which will further exacerbate the problem of long - term unemployment . " Um , are you avoiding the public ?

As regards the ability of the Netherlands to define the part of the population targeted by early school leaving measures , the situation mentioned by the Court has currently been remedied through the use of a national database . In many mentioned Member States targets have been set to reduce early school leaving , which is in line with the European objective . In the medium and long term , the number of early school leavers should reduce the number of early school leavers . under the programme , the national power of a Member State is to allocate funds between its regions or between measures . such distribution corresponds to the criteria , including political , as it takes into account the needs of the territory .
R457	The Committee agrees with the recommendations , but should take into account the political nature of the decision to allocate funds . the objective criteria of the selection of beneficiaries are now used in several of these cases .

In order to ensure consistency between rules on the disclosure and use of certain documents in the file of a competition authority , it is also necessary to amend the existing rules on the conduct of Commission proceedings laid down in Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 773/2004[44 ] , in particular as regards access to the Commission file and the use of documents obtained from this file and explanatory communications published by the Commission [ 45 ] . the Commission intends to do so once this Directive has been adopted by the European Parliament and the Council .

The Finanzgericht Düsseldorf therefore referred the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling : Case C-147/10 British Sugar 48 .

In its opinion of 13 January 2010 , the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use recommended provisional MRLs for muscle , skin , fat , liver and kidney of turkeys . The provisional MRL represents 96 % of the maximum daily intake of residues contained in turkeys . Sodium salicylate should therefore not be used in animals producing eggs for human consumption . Therefore , the entry for sodium salicylate in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation ( EU ) No 37/2010 should be amended to include the recommended provisional MRLs for sodium salicylate in turkeys and to exclude the use of this substance in animals producing eggs for human consumption . The provisional MRL set out in that table for sodium salicylate should apply until 1 January 2015 .

R501	115 As is apparent from recital 527 of the contested decision , the Commission relied on the finding that , where an undertaking participated in an infringement for a certain period of time during which it consistently consisted of different legal entities , it can not rely on limitation rules which would result from those internal reorganisations . Otherwise , undertakings could easily avoid the application of limitation rules by internal reorganisation . Article 81 EC and the rules on limitation laid down in Article 25 of Regulation No 1/2003 apply to undertakings and not to the legal entities from which those undertakings are composed . It follows that , where legal persons which are part of Akzo are involved in the infringement , the limitation period begins to run on the day on which the infringement of that undertaking ends . 116 The Commission states that the first investigation measures were carried out in January and February 2003 , which resumed the five - year limitation period and that further investigative measures followed , so that the first contested decision was adopted within five years of the last investigation measure . and you wo n't get nothin' without me !

However , this claim was rejected as the selection of the sampled companies was made in accordance with Article 17(1 ) of the basic Regulation , i.e. on the basis of the largest representative volume of exports which could reasonably be investigated within the time available . Another exporting producer objected to the conclusions by explicitly refusing to be included in the sample , so that it could not be considered to be a cooperating party . First , the company claimed that , pursuant to Article 17(2 ) of the basic Regulation , the selection of the sample had to be made with the agreement of the parties , leaving them the possibility not to be part of the sample . In conclusion , the company claimed that it should have received a notice of the consequences of non - cooperation as set out in Article 18(1 ) of the basic Regulation .
R512	In conclusion , it is noted that the company did not request individual examination pursuant to Article 17(3 ) of the basic Regulation .

The company was specified that the inclusion in the sample meant completing the questionnaire and accepting an on - the - spot examination of their response , which was rejected by this company . In any event , it is noted that despite the MET treatment of the company , the refusal to be included in the sample , the failure to submit a questionnaire reply pursuant to Article 17(3 ) of the basic Regulation and the refusal of a verification visit would mean that the provisions of Article 18 of the basic Regulation should be applied .

R517	A group of experts indicated that Major General Gaffar Mohammed ELHASSAN informed them that at the time he was in command of the Western Military Region , he had direct operational command ( mainly tactical command ) over all elements of the SAF in Darfur . ELHASSAN was the commander of the Western Military Region since November 2004 ( approximately ) to the beginning of 2006 . According to the information available to the group of experts , the ELHASSAN was responsible for infringement of paragraph 7 of Security Council Resolution 1591 by requesting ( from Khartoum ) and authorising ( after 29 March 2005 ) transfers of military equipment to Darfur without prior approval by the Committee established pursuant to UNSCR 1591 . ELHASSAN itself admitted to the group of experts that , between 29 March 2005 and December 2005 , aircraft , aircraft engines and other military equipment were transferred to Darfur from other parts of Sudan . For example , he informed the expert group that two Mi-24 attack helicopters had been unlawfully moved to Darfur between 18 and 21 September 2005 . There are also reasonable grounds to believe that ELHASSAN was directly responsible for the approval of offensive military flights in the area around the municipality of Abu Hamra on 23 and 24 July 2005 and in the Jebel Moon area of West Darfur on 19 November 2005 .

Under these circumstances , it is appropriate to adopt a specific transitional measure exempting those operators from the requirement to submit refund certificates in the period from 1 January 2007 to 28 February 2007 . It is also appropriate to derogate from Article 47(2 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 1043/2005 and to allow operators in Bulgaria and Romania to authorise , during the period from 1 January 2007 to 28 February 2007 , subject to the entry into force of the Act of Accession on 1 January 2007 , the derogation provided for in Article 46 of that Regulation .

The work culminated in the Green Paper Consultation[4 ] and the High Level Conference on Agricultural Product Quality held in Prague [ 5 ] from 12 to 13 March 2009 .

R549	Reason REPORT The Natura 2000 area The Voordelta is home to plants and fauna of special ecological value . For certain species and their habitats , the Netherlands is obliged to indicate them in a ' favourable conservation status' and to preserve them in this state . Under this Law on Nature Conservation , a management plan must be established for each Natura 2000 area . In the main planning decision of the project , the development of the Port Rotterdam Main Port 2006 ( ' the territorial decision' ) provides that this loss is to be compensated by the establishment of an area of conservation in another part of the Voordelta , where usage restrictions could be introduced . Environmental requirements have been taken into account and compared with the extent to which human activity restrictions should be imposed , in particular with regard to existing human or other use of the area . compensatory measures complementary to the objectives set out in the Natura 2000 network are to be taken on the Access Restriction Decree under consideration . Measures In the short term , it is important to limit access to certain parts of the Voordelta in order to be able to compensate in good time for the effects of the construction and operation of Maasvlakte 2 and to continue to monitor the conservation and conservation of ecologically valuable plants and animals listed in the Voordelta Designation Decree .

However , the Cypriot authorities argued that Cyprus Airways was particularly serious , which allegedly justified a lower own contribution , in particular in view of the economic and financial situation of the country and the Turkey overflight ban . The Cypriot authorities also pointed to a significant reduction in capacity . with regard to the ' one time , last time' principle , the Cypriot authorities reiterated their claims concerning the impact of the financial crisis on Greece and Cyprus , the ban on the overflight of Cypriot aircraft over Turkey , the operation of an ' illegal' airport in the occupied northern part of Cyprus , the unstable political situation in the Middle East and the fact that the granting of rescue and/or restructuring aid should not constitute a sufficient reason for prohibiting another support .
R682	The relevant warnings about the negative impact of the economic situation in Europe and of restlessness in the Middle East on Cyprus Airways , already mentioned in the company 's annual reports for 2007 , 2008 and 2009 , which the Commission referred to in its decision of 6 March 2013 , were considered as ' general claims' . The overflight ban over Turkey meant that Cyprus Airways was at a disadvantage for the operation of flights to the Russian market due to the longer flight time . The Cypriot authorities have also provided evidence that , although the number of passengers on the Greek market has decreased only marginally since 2008 , the average fare for flights in Greece ( including domestic flights ) has fallen significantly . As regards the short - term loan of EUR 10 million , the Cypriot authorities indicated that the sale of the evening slot at LHR airport was expected to take place at a higher price and therefore it would not be necessary to grant the loan . The Cypriot authorities justified the grant of training aid in the period 2010 - 2011 by the fact that Cyprus Airways only experienced difficulties in late 2011 . was in contradiction with their previous submissions ( see recital 68 ) .

OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Council Regulation ( EC ) No 732/2008 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011 EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM The European Union grants trade preferences under the scheme of generalised tariff preferences to developing countries . The scheme of generalised tariff preferences is implemented through successive Regulations applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences with a shelf life of three years . The current system is established by Council Regulation ( EC ) No 732/2008 , which will expire 31 December 2011 . The GSP shall be terminated after this day of operation of the GSP , unless appropriate legislative measures are taken to ensure that it is maintained . The subsequent GSP Regulation should be based on a proposal from the Commission , taking due account of relevant aspects relating to the effectiveness of the current GSP system in achieving the objectives and proposing amendments to ensure that its effectiveness is maintained in the future . internal work on the preparation of the Commission proposal of the subsequent Regulation began by public consultation in March 2010 . The length of the subsequent legislative procedure can not be predicted with certainty , but it is likely to last at least 15 to 18 months .

Bailiffs then consign the money , documentary credits and precious objects they have found to the Clerk of the Court . all other items , in particular immovable assets , are entrusted to a custodian ( or , under certain conditions , to the debtor , for example , if the debtor lives in the property ) . In any event , the court responsible for enforcement gives the custodian or administrator of the assets suitable instructions pending the sale or assignment of the asset to the creditor . These instructions must be followed , and the custodian or administrator are liable under civil law ( for any damages ) and under criminal law , on the basis of various provisions in the Criminal Code , if items are removed , destroyed or allowed to deteriorate as a result of acts committed voluntarily or acts of negligence .

R707	123 Furthermore , it is apparent from the documents analysed in paragraphs 114 to 121 above that the decisions of the Lombard Club concerned essentially fundamental issues and were prepared in detail by other committees . 124 In addition , it must be borne in mind that BAWAG and PSK , which seek to minimise the probative value of those documents claiming that ' the role of the Lombard Club' was misunderstood and overestimated by the participants in other meetings , usually middle management workers . The Commission can not therefore be criticised for having overestimated the probative value of those documents . 125 Finally , contrary to what BAWAG and PSK claim , it is clear from the documents analysed that the references to the management role of the Lombard Club in recitals 304 and 306 of the contested decision are not isolated cases . This is also confirmed by the CA , submitted by BAWAG and PSK in an annex to their actions , informing the addressees of the content of the round table on assets and liabilities of 17 April 1996 . That report envisages the preparation of a proposal to be approved in the course of that round table in order to be discussed and , as the case may be , an agreement within the framework of the Lombard Club . 126 It follows from the foregoing considerations that the pleas directed against the classification of a single global cartel attributed to the committees are unfounded .

Introduction On 23 May 2008 , the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products ( 1 ) . The proposal is based on Article 95 of the Treaty ( 2 ) . This proposal has been complemented by an impact assessment . The European Parliament delivered its opinion at first reading on 23 April 2009 ( 3 ) . The Economic and Social Committee delivered its opinion on 25 February 2009 ( 4 ) . The Commission presented an amended proposal on 20 October 2009 ( 5 ) . Put your cloak on , put a hood over your head , and no one will know anything . You 're tall enough .

And , more importantly , I loved him like a son . No , I like him . Let 's talk in the present time while we still can .

Lend the movie Dirty Dancing and just tell her you love her . You know , it 's really important to enjoy life while you can . Victoria accepted an offer to kill us from Ml6 . She 's a friend . Frank , what do you think she never had a contract for killing a boyfriend ?
R713	We were there now . No . Thank me ? Who 's in charge here ? The poisonous river of Léthe , which sprang in the swamp of the Malga , and then turned west in the meandering meanders to the base of the great Rocky Mountains that disappeared into the wasteland of the Kierlak Desert . Only a man who would have come here , guided by some inexplicable madness , would try to climb down . Fortunately , there was a passageway in this barrier , in the form of a small canyon running through a series of rocky hills that stretched for several hundred yards , forming the southern edge of a terrible circle . In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , it should be left to the Member States to decide whether the first purchaser should submit to the farmer a written offer of such a contract . Given the need to establish appropriate minimum requirements for such contracts and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and the common market organisation , certain basic conditions for the use of such contracts should be laid down at Union level . all these basic conditions should , however , be freely negotiated . However , where certain Member States with a broadly extended use of very short - term contracts decide to strengthen the stability of the milk market or outlet for milk producers , they should be able to set a minimum duration of such contracts or offers .
R714	In addition , it should not interfere with the proper functioning of the internal market and the milk producers should be able to refrain from using or rejecting the minimum duration of the contracts . As regards the basic conditions , it is important that the price payable for the supply can be laid down in a contract , as decided by the parties , either as a fixed price or as a variable price on the basis of defined factors such as the volume and quality or composition of the raw milk supplied , without excluding the possibility of combining a fixed price for a certain volume and variable prices for the additional volume of raw milk delivered under a single contract . In the interests of simplicity , the obligation to apply a written contract should not apply to dairy cooperatives which have , in their statutes or in the rules and decisions laid down in the framework or pursuant to these Statutes , a provision with a similar effect to the basic conditions for contracts laid down in this Regulation . In order to enhance the effectiveness of the aforementioned system - based system , where intermediaries collect milk from farmers to supply it to processors , Member States should be able to apply that system to those intermediaries .
R715	Furthermore , existing producer organisations recognised under national law should be given the possibility of de facto recognised under this Regulation . 22It follows that , in accordance with Article 17(2)(a ) of the Sixth Directive , Articles 2 and 3 of the VAT Order do not , in accordance with Article 17(2)(a ) of the Sixth Directive , allow a taxable person to deduct VAT on fuel supplied to non - taxable persons , that is to say , employees , under conditions which do not ensure that the VAT deducted is expressly applied to fuels used for the purposes of taxable transactions . taxable persons . 23 However , the United Kingdom Government observes that the necessary relationship between the right to deduct VAT and the use of fuel for the taxable person 's taxable transactions is ensured by the provisions of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 , as applied by the United Kingdom tax authorities . The Government explains that the system of reimbursement of costs , which allows the right of deduction of VAT and which is recognised by the tax authorities , operates as follows . The employee shall first transmit to the employer a detailed account of the distance in kilometres , indicating the routes which have been carried out on commercial purposes and the corresponding distance in kilometres , as well as the capacity of the vehicle used .

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY INDUSTRY AND DIMENSION OF CONSUMPTION One interested party was argued that the bad harvests of 2002 and 2003 and the decrease in production associated with a shortage of raw material , i.e. fresh strawberries during these years , were an important cooperating factor causing injury to the Community industry . The lower production and sales volumes were accompanied by a decrease in prices , but are usually due to bad harvests and lower price increases . In addition , the review of the profitability of the Community industry over the period considered shows that the industry was still profitable until 2004 , when there was a significant decrease in the prices of imports from the PRC . It was also argued that the consumption of the product concerned has decreased on the Community market and that the reason for the injury suffered by the Community industry is precisely this decrease and not the dumped imports from the PRC .

R736	As a result of this operation , it will be possible to subscribe to a significant and even majority ( 54 % ) of Alitalia 's shares under the same terms and conditions as the public shareholder , since the price of the shares is identical , just as the related rights resulting from each share are the same for all shareholders . In this context , the Commission assumes that there must be no ancillary or unfair agreements on the basis of which the Italian State could relieve the banks of their obligations in the event that the offer of recapitalisation measures was not sufficiently subscribed to on the market .

Therefore , for 2020 , estimates of population growth , including migration , are estimated at 14 million . of these , 5.3 would be Spain , 4 to the United Kingdom , 1.4 in Italy , 1.3 to France , almost 1 million to Ireland , about half a million to Sweden and Belgium , and less than half a million to Portugal .

In addition , the population of between 20 and 59 would decrease by 4.7 million .

As regards the latter , it is true that the deductibility of input tax is an explicit condition only for the application of Articles 5(6 ) and 6(2)(a ) , but I consider that it is necessarily implicit in Article 6(2)(b ) . The reason for the absence of such concerns is , in particular , the very limited presence of Thomson in sales and trading . III.B Research and asset management The Commission 's analysis has shown that the concentration raises competition concerns as regards broker reports , yield estimates , basic data and time series of economic data . As regards these four data categories , Thomson and Reuters are the main suppliers in the market , with competitors unable to provide equivalent data in terms of depth ( history ) and scope ( geographical coverage ) . many competitors also distribute data by Thomson or Reuters . In this capacity Thomson / Reuters would have an incentive and the possibility to increase their prices subsequently .
R830	The majority of customers buy desktop solutions comprising several categories of data together with analytical software . For the desktop desktop , Thomson and Reuters compete with competitors who can purchase certain data categories by Thomson and Reuters as an input for their own desktop . In this respect , the distribution of desktop is vertically linked to the provision of data categories . This vertical relationship may further increase the parties ' incentive to increase prices for the provision of such databases to customers through competitors ' platforms or to limit the provision of such data categories to Thomson / Reuters ' own customers in order to induce customers to give priority to a package ( data and application tools ) by Thomson / Reuters instead of a package of competitors . broker reports Broker reports are prepared by brokerage companies who wish to obtain commission on transactions and which provide financial information about businesses and markets . ( i ) real - time research ( distribution of broker reports during the first 7 - 30 days after their publication ) , when reports are distributed in order to stimulate transactions ; and ( ii ) follow - up ( distribution of reports after this initial period ) , where reports are used , for example , by investment bankers to obtain an overview of the company or sector 's situation . The market investigation stressed that competition concerns related to the distribution of follow - up research .

In order to determine whether Íslenskt sement ehf . paid a price for state shares below their market value , the Authority instructed an independent expert to assess the market values of Sementsverksmiðjan hf . at the time of the sale . The independent expert assessed the company 's market value after carrying out the entire transfer , taking into account the company operating . That means that the independent expert assessed the market value of Sementsverksmiðjan hf . after the State Treasury had purchased some of the assets of the company that was not necessary for the production of cement ( 13 ) , and the Ministry of Finance took over the pension - related liabilities of the company . In other words , the independent expert assessed the market value of what Íslenskt sement ehf . had actually purchased , i.e. shares in the adjusted company . The Icelandic authorities were invited to provide the information and calculations needed to establish these boundaries ( 15 ) in order to obtain the notion of the market value of the principal activity , which is the production of cement .
R833	On this basis , the Icelandic authorities were invited , at the request of the independent expert , to submit two scenarios : scenario I which would envisage imports of cement to Iceland at 30 % of the total market , and Scenario II , which would not include any imports . By adjusting the net present value measures by subtracting long - term debt and adding surplus of net current assets , the Icelandic Government has reached the estimate of the value of equity to ISK 897 million for Scenario I and ISK 307 million for Scenario II . capacity utilisation was decisive for differences in the outcome . The variable cost of production per tonne was estimated from ISK 5 749 in years with full capacity utilisation ( 130 000 tonnes ) up to ISK 7 479 in years with low capacity utilisation ( 70 000 tonnes ) . Competent authorities , ESMA , other relevant authorities and other bodies or natural and legal persons receiving confidential information in the course of their duties under this Regulation shall use that information only in the performance of their duties .

Models of general policy conditions The previous block exemption regulations provided for an exemption for the joint creation and dissemination of a non - binding model of general policy conditions ( VPCs ) for direct insurance ( 14 ) . On the basis of evidence established during the review , the Commission no longer considers the sectoral exemption regulation necessary , given that cooperation on the VPP is not specific to the insurance sector , but is common to many other sectors which can not be used by the Block Exemption Regulation , such as the banking sector .
R859	As the VPP is not specific to the insurance sector , it is appropriate to establish certain guidance on VPP in the whole field , in the form of a horizontal instrument . VPP , for example , makes it possible to compare the insurance conditions offered by different insurers , allowing customers to verify more easily the content of the guarantees and to make it easier for them to change the insurer and insurance products . While comparability of insurance products for consumers is necessary , excessive harmonisation can be detrimental to consumers and may lead to a lack of competition in a non - price area . Moreover , given that some SPCs may be unbalanced , it is preferable for undertakings to carry out their own assessment on the basis of Article 101(3 ) of the Treaty in the event of the application of Article 101(1 ) of the Treaty in order to demonstrate that the cooperation in which it participates promotes efficiency gains , which can largely benefit consumers ( 15 ) . The Commission therefore intends to extend the scope of the horizontal guidelines to VPP in all sectors . This guidance is currently under review and in the first half of 2010 it is planned to publish the revised horizontal guidelines for stakeholder consultation .

R867	While the Committee appreciates the will expressed by all the EU institutions to strengthen its role , it would nevertheless like to stress that the proposal , in the form set out in the Reflection Paper that the Committee would only receive statistical data for the performance of its work , would deprive it of all means to carry out appropriate controls on OLAF . It is essential that the Committee has full access to investigation files so that it can ensure its independence by checking the effectiveness of OLAF 's investigation procedures . In the context of the reform process , the Committee also warns of the danger of ' overhauling' which would deprive OLAF of the necessary room for manoeuvre . Any further legal obligation in the course of regulation could , moreover , result in judicial review at a later stage . The Committee also considers that the next Director General of OLAF should be consulted on this reform . This document is a contribution from the SC for discussion . It takes into account the interinstitutional discussions already carried out and aims to express the Committee 's views on the main points of the discussion document . Based on an analysis of ways of improving the effectiveness of investigations ( Part I ) , it presents proposals on the organisational aspects of OLAF ( Part II ) . The three EU Institutions presented various proposals to address this key issue and these proposals should be carefully studied .

Households may apply for a maximum of 20 % of documented and eligible costs . subsidies for pellet stoves and electronic control systems are limited to NOK 4 000 .

The budget of the scheme was adapted by the adoption of the proposals contained in Parliament 's proposal No 22 ( 2006 - 2007 ) , Parliament 's proposal No 59 ( 2007 - 2008 ) and Parliament 's proposal No 1 ( 2008 - 2009 ) .

" The main problem , which was the exact second of departure , was calculated three weeks ago ; every six months there would be only one short period of time during which a ship to Mars could leave the Luna - Terra system after the most economical orbit . after the test of the previous day , Captain Stone had dealt with a second problem , that is to say , how many buoyancy in the jets and how long it was necessary to get a particular ship into orbit . The answer to this second question was now addressed by Castor , along with the automatic pilot . The first orbital section would not be in the direction of Mars , but to Earth the next critical moment would be as sensitive as the launch itself . Captain Stone frowned at that thought , but then he shrugged ; this concern would be on the show afterwards . I 'm going downstairs . " Come on , guys , get to work .

R899	carefully considered the arguments put forward by the farmers ' associations . It is undisputed that the Union farmers have access to the product concerned produced by Union producers and third country producers other than the Russian exporting producers . but above all , as confirmed during the hearing , which was held on 19 June 2014 , and contrary to the assumption in an economic study , there is no guarantee that any initial potential drop in prices of the product concerned ( if the measures in force were allowed to lapse ) would be passed on to the end users . In the analysis of the Union interest , the proportionality of the continuation of measures is assessed and various , sometimes opposing interests are taken into account . The continuation of measures is in the interest of the Union producers because their abolition would force many of them to put an end to the business . As the Commission does not have evidence that a measure incurs disproportionate costs for farmers as a result of the measure , it is therefore in the interest of the Union to maintain measures . In any event , the farmers admitted that they would prefer to prefer more sources of supply and that the disappearance of the Union industry would not be in their interest .
R900	Finally , as mentioned in recital 193 , there is no indication that the repeal of the measures would lead to a decrease in the prices of AN which would be passed on to users , leading to a switch to ammonium nitrate from other , more polluting fertilisers . The positive environmental impact is therefore not substantiated . Any positive environmental impact would in any event not be so large that this would be contrary to the overall interest of the Union in maintaining the measures . Charlie , are you okay ?

Annex VI Guidance on the reporting of direct land use change emissions relevant for climate change This Annex provides guidance on the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions related to direct land use change contributing to climate change . The impact on climate is due to biogenic CO 2 emissions and removals due to carbon stock changes and biogenic and non - biogenic CO 2 , N 2 O and CH 4 emissions ( e.g. biomass burning ) . Biogenic emissions include emissions resulting from burning ( combustion ) or biodegradation of biogenic materials , treatment of waste water and biological resources in soil and water ( including CO2 , CH 4 and N 2 O ) , while biogenic removals correspond to the intake of CO 2 during photosynthesis .

Although some Member States have reported non - compliant samples , it can generally be concluded that the limit values ( and tolerance limits of the test methods ) exceeded less samples compared to previous years . Several new EU-10 Member States reported a significant number of non - compliance with limit values in previous years , but the number of non - compliant samples reported by these countries decreased significantly in 2006 . In 2005 , Belgium announced a higher proportion ( ~3.5 % ) of non - compliant samples than other Member States ( but an improvement compared to previous years ) , but the data provided in 2006 were insufficient to assess the actual number of non - compliant samples . The Commission is not aware of any negative consequences for vehicle emissions or engine function related to the exceedance of the limit values , but continues to urge the Member States to take action to ensure full compliance . The majority of Member States are already doing so and details of the actions taken in relation to the non - compliance , if provided , are included in the country chapters in the 2006 detailed report [ 6 ] . The Commission will continue to monitor compliance with the fuel quality requirements laid down in the Directive .
